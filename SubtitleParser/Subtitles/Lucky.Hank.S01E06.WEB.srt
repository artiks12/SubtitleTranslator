1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:09,269
<i>Hey, Dad, welcome to Railton.</i>

2
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,072
<i>Just a couple questions.</i>

3
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,234
<i>How come you didn't
come to my wedding?</i>

4
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:17,717
<i>Or want to meet your
only grandchild?</i>

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:20,921
<i>Or how could you abandon me</i>

6
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:23,163
<i>when I had a rope
around my neck?</i>

7
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:26,366
<i>That's it, just those questions.</i>

8
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:29,489
<i>Feel free to write your
answers on a postcard</i>

9
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,092
<i>and mail it to me.</i>

10
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:36,058
<i>Then we can go back to
avoiding each other.</i>

11
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:54,574
I'm coming in!

12
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,618
Dad! Get out!

13
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,507
Hmm...

14
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:14,074
I almost took a shower
with our daughter.

15
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:15,635
Yeah, she came in the night.

16
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,934
She slept upstairs
in her old room.

17
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,278
What's that about?

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,599
Mmm...

19
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,643
She didn't want to say,
she wanted to sleep.

20
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:23,803
If we turned her
room into a gym,

21
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:25,085
this wouldn't happen.

22
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,287
Or she'd get into great shape.

23
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,449
- Bright side.
- Mmm.

24
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:37,899
- I saw my father on Tuesday.
- What?

25
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,622
I was in my car. I just
wanted to get a glimpse.

26
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,666
There he was.

27
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:49,869
What did he say? Or
just how... did it go?

28
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,471
We didn't talk.

29
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:53,473
I don't want to be lied to,

30
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:58,318
and I only want to know
he's here because he's old,

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,042
unemployed, and wants
to be taken care of.

32
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:04,884
- That's understandable.
- I'm going for a run.

33
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,526
- Great.
- That's... important.

34
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:08,047
Oh, it's my mom.

35
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,529
Oh, yeah, she's been calling me.

36
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,291
You too?

37
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,973
- Did you talk to her?
- No, no, I wouldn't know what to say to her.

38
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,861
Why haven't you
answered my calls?

39
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:24,065
Because my, um, caller ID works.

40
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,148
You hurt your father
very badly, you know.

41
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,029
He played me the
message you left.

42
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,671
Oh, he's keeping my messages.

43
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,593
What message?

44
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:35,133
Oh, I didn't tell you, I
left a message for my dad.

45
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,157
I told him he's not
welcome here in Railton.

46
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,520
It was a cruel thing to say.

47
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,322
It stung him very badly.

48
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,324
It was so over the line,

49
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,983
Henry says he's leaving
after the weekend.

50
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:48,047
He says he's going
to North Carolina.

51
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,929
North Carolina? What's
in North Carolina?

52
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,331
Oh,

53
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,773
a graduate student that
he hasn't seduced yet.

54
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:57,497
- Gruen.
- What's that, the monster from <i>Beowulf?</i>

55
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,898
His second wife.

56
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:03,703
It would be a terrible
situation for him,

57
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,906
living out the last of his days

58
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:09,108
in a place he has
no connection to,

59
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,192
far from any family...

60
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,154
and the monster's Grendel.

61
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:15,693
Well, you tell him
to have a nice trip,

62
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:18,718
and the monster
is Grendel's mom.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,360
Hank!

64
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,124
This is something that's
very important to me.

65
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:25,365
He'll leave for good

66
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:27,889
if you don't come by
and ask him to stay.

67
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:31,733
I'm not going to do that.

68
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:34,776
I'm asking you.

69
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:37,737
Hank isn't available
this weekend.

70
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,780
He has a conference.

71
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,942
Is that true?

72
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:45,185
It's true I've been
invited to a conference,

73
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,586
in Harrisburg.

74
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,750
Oh, you can skip that.

75
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,911
You have a choice to make

76
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:54,354
between your father

77
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:57,198
and an insignificant
regional conference.

78
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,998
It's good for guys
to have a thing.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
This conference is
kind of our thing.

80
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,043
And the one year you
decided to pull out

81
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,445
is the one year I'm presenting.

82
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:26,744
I was beginning to
take it personally.

83
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:29,489
Yeah, I've had a lot
going on, you know.

84
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:31,411
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

85
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,453
It's just that you decided
not to come weeks ago,

86
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,094
like the minute
you saw the program

87
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:37,074
with my name and photo
prominently displayed on it.

88
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,218
- I did?
- Mmm-hmm.

89
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,021
I think we have a different
definition of "prominent".

90
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:43,521
It's page three. Page
three is the best.

91
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:45,024
Phew...

92
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,509
- I got two other pages that
will knock your socks off.

93
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,592
Let's go.

94
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:53,873
I hope I don't meet
anyone from last year.

95
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,533
- You probably won't.
- Or the year before.

96
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:59,519
Uh, Rosencrantz and <i>Señor</i>
Guildenstern, please.

97
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:00,858
How many times have
you heard that today?

98
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,482
Beats the Nietzsche brothers.

99
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:03,883
No, it does not.

100
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,927
Devereaux and Conigula.

101
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,968
Go right to page three?

102
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,850
Whoa, whoa.

103
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,052
I did not know Gracie
was going to be here.

104
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,974
Quick, hand me my
fake moustache.

105
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,496
You've got a beard.

106
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:20,179
Right. So, my
Austin Powers teeth.

107
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,542
- You're too kind.
- -Look at her, holding court.

108
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:24,384
Wait till they find
out she's an idiot.

109
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,506
That <i>Atlantic</i> poem
was a total fluke.

110
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:27,885
It was one of those
infinite monkey things?

111
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,789
Infinite monkey? No.

112
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:31,791
Twenty monkeys,

113
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,514
and they can take breaks,
and they need one typewriter.

114
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:36,756
They'll poop out that
poem in 10 minutes.

115
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:39,118
- Come on.
- No, no, drinks first. Come on.

116
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,880
I can't believe

117
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,820
that was just your first poem
published in <i>The Atlantic.</i>

118
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,365
- Wonderful.
- And such specificity.

119
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,006
Do you write with
a pen or a scalpel?

120
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,088
Oh, please.

121
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,130
You all honour me, truly.

122
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:53,132
Honestly, I don't
know what comes next.

123
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:56,896
I'm just trying to slurp the
marrow from the present moment.

124
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:58,315
- Poet laureate, 5:00.
- Dr. Grillo!

125
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,739
What?

126
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,382
Ms. DuBois, when I read
your poem in <i>The Atlantic,</i>

127
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,023
I revisited your
book of sonnets.

128
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:07,306
- I've added it to the syllabus for my spring seminar.
- Oh.

129
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:10,029
I'm collecting selected poems

130
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,632
for an anthology of
contemporary poets

131
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,554
re-imagining traditional forms.

132
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:17,557
I would love to include
a villanelle of yours.

133
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,198
Let's get a drink later.

134
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,242
I would love that. I would...

135
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,847
I do remember you, yes.

136
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,529
You had a hat with
a feather in it,

137
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:30,650
and the feather blew off

138
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,772
and landed in a
lady's drink, right?

139
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:34,574
Uh, that was you.

140
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,416
Well, I prefer to be
remembered for my work...

141
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,937
- Well...
- but I'll take it.

142
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,837
Hank's a novelist, so it's
his job to be kind of a dick.

143
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,180
Ah.

144
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,381
When do you present?

145
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,783
Tomorrow afternoon.

146
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:47,226
I have a paper on Ecophilosophy
in a Post-Roe World.

147
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:48,668
How about you, Hank?

148
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,630
Are you presenting?

149
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:54,033
- I don't know.
- You don't know if you're presenting?

150
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,596
So you were saying about Appiah's
piece in the <i>Times</i> last Sunday?

151
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,157
Absolute rubbish.

152
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:00,159
This widower wrote in

153
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:03,603
- to ask if it would be ethical to read his deceased...
- Sorry.

154
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:06,608
And asked him
specifically not to do.

155
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,812
Uh, gin martini,
extra olives, please.

156
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:33,515
Thank you.

157
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,772
- That would be a mistake.
- What?

158
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:54,814
That woman you followed in here.

159
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:57,096
"Anna Howard, professor
of comparative literature,

160
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,018
University of Michigan."

161
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,060
However tempting, a dalliance for a dalliance
is not an ethically-sound idea.

162
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,223
I shouldn't be here.

163
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,307
You're my biggest fan.
I'm on page three.

164
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:11,470
I'm afraid I'm going
to do something stupid.

165
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,952
Let me get you a drink.

166
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,434
After that, get a
massage, take a schvitz.

167
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,716
Do any stupid thing you want,

168
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,037
except boink her,

169
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,081
'cause you'd regret it.

170
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,570
<i>When am I going to learn</i>

171
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:33,372
<i>that hotel rooms
aren't fun anymore?</i>

172
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,055
<i>I mean, when you're young,
they're full of potential,</i>

173
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,458
<i>an exotic alternative to
your own crappy bedroom,</i>

174
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,701
<i>and clean sheets, too,</i>

175
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:42,982
<i>but at some point,</i>

176
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,383
<i>you just start thinking</i>

177
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:47,308
<i>about all the losers who
stayed here before you.</i>

178
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:50,311
<i>Oh, that's sad.</i>

179
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:52,792
<i>All the losers,</i>

180
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,113
<i>hoping beyond hope</i>

181
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,956
<i>to meet someone in the
hotel bar and get laid.</i>

182
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,530
Hey!

183
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:13,372
- Do you need a hand?
- Hi, yeah.

184
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:15,695
Can you put this
in the very front.

185
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:18,097
Are you finally
moving your stuff out?

186
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,219
Mom, how many times are we
going to talk about this?

187
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:22,622
Is it such an inconvenience
for me to keep, like,

188
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,423
a little bit of my
stuff at your house?

189
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,425
I thought you liked
having this conversation.

190
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,988
I thought that's why you
kept your things here

191
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,991
even though you have your
own big storage space.

192
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,035
Trunk.

193
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:36,956
Are you going somewhere?

194
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,798
Yeah, Russell and I had a fight,

195
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,920
so I'm going to take
you up on that offer.

196
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:42,121
What offer?

197
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,165
I'm going to come stay
with you in New York.

198
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:46,125
Okay, let's just, um...

199
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,446
Let's just back this up.

200
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:48,808
How bad a fight was this?

201
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,852
That's none of your business.

202
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:52,932
Julie!

203
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,373
- Mom.
- You are married.

204
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:56,175
You cannot just run away

205
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,474
from the first big
fight you guys have.

206
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:59,739
First big fight.

207
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,220
Mom, Russell
literally is like...

208
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,182
Mom!

209
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,184
Russell is just...

210
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,786
he's pissing me off,

211
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,068
and this is... Honestly,
this is all Dad's fault.

212
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,189
How so?

213
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,633
Because he got him that
job, and it destroyed us.

214
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,794
It just destroyed us.

215
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,156
Like, I honestly don't
think we've had sex

216
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:19,398
more than, like, ten
times in the last month.

217
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,280
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes,

218
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,402
and he's not masturbating
like he used to,

219
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:25,645
so he's totally cheating on me.

220
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:26,966
Julie.

221
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:28,848
Honey, do you... Do
you really think so?

222
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,892
- I mean...
- Yes.

223
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,305
And they brought nothing.

224
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:48,067
Nothing.

225
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:50,127
Like, when I go to her house,
I bring a banana bread,

226
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:51,230
or a zucchini bread,

227
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,792
a bottle of wine, something,

228
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,291
and this is, like, the
third time it's happened

229
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,492
where she shows up empty-handed.

230
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:56,796
I just think it's disrespectful.

231
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:58,015
At this point, she should
not be invited anymore.

232
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,198
That's what I think!

233
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,242
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,563
Hank?

235
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,607
Hank?

236
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,813
Dad?

237
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,735
How did you...

238
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,660
Apparently, you
have a beef with me.

239
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,983
And it boils down to one thing.

240
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,985
How could you leave us?

241
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:08,387
Me,

242
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,071
the way that you did.

243
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,553
That's a fair question.

244
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:16,395
Look, son,

245
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:17,917
there are three things

246
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,558
that you don't know
about the situation.

247
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
In fact, three simple things,

248
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,122
once I tell you,

249
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:24,924
I think you'll
understand completely.

250
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,685
In fact,

251
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,528
you might even be happy.

252
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,572
One...

253
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:35,817
Oh, it's hot in here.

254
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:38,377
Can you do the thing

255
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,421
to get us more steam?

256
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:17,977
<i>One of the few</i>

257
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,539
<i>of all these species
who mate for life.</i>

258
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,620
<i>Hello?</i>

259
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:02,902
<i>Hank?</i>

260
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:06,265
I hear the sounds of
a party down the hall.

261
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:07,706
Female voices.

262
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,268
<i>What time is it?</i>

263
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,991
Are you already in bed?

264
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,593
<i>Yeah. My presentation
is in the morning.</i>

265
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:14,713
<i>You're coming, right?</i>

266
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,475
Of course.

267
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,037
It's hours away.

268
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,920
I mean, come on, I really
need a distraction.

269
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,865
Ooh, what are the specials?

270
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:50,069
We have vodka and soda,

271
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,830
and...

272
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,712
soda with vodka in it.

273
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:54,873
Oh, that's a tough choice.

274
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:58,157
I'd say soda with vodka?

275
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,239
I'm going to look for some
of those female voices.

276
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,881
Cheers.

277
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,731
<i>Hard to believe,</i>

278
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:15,213
<i>but these are some of the most
above-average minds in academia.</i>

279
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,777
<i>Why are they here?</i>

280
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,180
<i>Will they change the world?</i>

281
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:24,103
<i>Not unless being published
in an academic journal</i>

282
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,664
<i>read by 40 people</i>

283
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,266
<i>is earth-shattering.</i>

284
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:28,966
<i>No, these people are in
a fierce competition.</i>

285
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,149
I don't know.

286
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:32,551
A provocative
thesis is one thing,

287
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,914
but Marjorie DeCampos
is going to be there.

288
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,556
- From Emory?
- Yes.

289
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,999
<i>They're battling to see
who can stick their heads</i>

290
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,601
<i>furthest up their
own butt holes.</i>

291
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,003
<i>Ah, maybe I can help.</i>

292
00:17:44,045 --> 00:17:45,324
Make sure you have a printout.

293
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:46,485
Why?

294
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,607
Uh, the virus.

295
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,090
What virus?

296
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:52,891
- You guys don't know?
- No.

297
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,693
Oh.

298
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:57,776
There's a computer virus being
spread by the hotel WiFi.

299
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,338
Oh, no.

300
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,837
Some hacker from outside
infected the whole system.

301
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:03,142
- When?
- Like an hour ago.

302
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:05,802
- Oh, my God!
- They've got an IT team from Zurich is working on it,

303
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,906
but I lost work from
the last four years,

304
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:09,788
so... effing nightmare.

305
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,990
I'm so sorry.

306
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:12,631
It probably won't
affect you guys

307
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:16,395
- because it only activates if you use certain programs.
- Oh.

308
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:18,998
- Word, or Google Docs...
- Oh, that's fine.

309
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,759
- Or, um...
- PowerPoint, and Keynote.

310
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:21,840
Oh, my God!

311
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:23,202
- What?
- Yeesh!

312
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,204
- That's everything.
- I'll tell you what,

313
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:27,046
it'll destroy your
hard drive. Good luck.

314
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:28,385
- Oh, no, no.
- My presentation is in Keynote.

315
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,849
Yeah, but mine is
tomorrow. I have two!

316
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:32,893
I have two presentations.

317
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:37,656
<i>I have to operate my
happy family of clothing.</i>

318
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:38,955
<i>Because it's a
charity rummage sale.</i>

319
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,179
<i>I know!</i>

320
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:41,260
<i>That you helped organise!</i>

321
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:43,142
This is the best.

322
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:45,186
This could be every
night in New York.

323
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:47,826
Hmm.

324
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:50,549
There's lots of stuff to
do in New York at night.

325
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,593
Yeah, but what's
better than this?

326
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,035
<i>Okay, get out of the way.</i>

327
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:57,596
<i>What are you doing?</i>

328
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,038
<i>Get away from the
closet, please.</i>

329
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,360
<i>No! Not that one! Oh!</i>

330
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,624
I see you bought
your own coffee.

331
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,146
Smart move.

332
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,308
They're feeding us
battery acid over here.

333
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,469
Hank.

334
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,671
Anna.

335
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,313
You're, uh, one of
the panelists, right?

336
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:15,554
You're the Bronte scholar?

337
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,636
- That's right.
- Where did you study?

338
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,518
Northwestern.

339
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Grad school?

340
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,161
Columbia.

341
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,922
See, I think we have
someone in common.

342
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:26,287
- Mmm.
- Henry Devereaux?

343
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,688
Henry?

344
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,690
Of course.

345
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,492
Yeah, he was my thesis advisor.

346
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:35,654
He was a real mentor to me.

347
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:37,698
Just a mentor?

348
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,860
So, did you study under
him as well, or...

349
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,904
No, but I know you did.

350
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,829
I'm his son.

351
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,995
Do you want something from me?

352
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:57,676
Not really.

353
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:58,917
Well, that's not true.

354
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:03,482
Did he ever mention

355
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:07,005
that he had a son
around your age?

356
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:10,088
I knew you existed, yeah.

357
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,491
Did he express any affection,

358
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,813
or have any fond memories?

359
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:16,857
It's hard to remember.

360
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,740
How about for you?

361
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,223
Do you feel like
he cared about you?

362
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:26,745
Do you think he's capable...

363
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,149
of caring?

364
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,993
You should talk to him.

365
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,797
He's a...

366
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,241
He's a good man.

367
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,444
Is he?

368
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,420
Poetic voice, so
readily identifiable,

369
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,782
her brachyology, use
of rhetorical terms,

370
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,264
wielding rhetorical devices,

371
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:07,266
syllepsis and apokoinou

372
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:08,947
like hatchets to her text

373
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:10,949
while she creates a syntax

374
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,150
for an urban landscape

375
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,353
she both describes
and rebirths...

376
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:16,835
I-I think I'm going to have to
challenge you on that, Fran...

377
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,076
Okay!

378
00:22:18,118 --> 00:22:19,638
Oh, here we go!

379
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,560
Why is it that we...

380
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,482
<i>How can someone not
be self-aware enough</i>

381
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,044
<i>to know they are irrelevant?</i>

382
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,447
<i>I mean, if your gut
doesn't tell you this,</i>

383
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,689
<i>there's a lot of clues.</i>

384
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:32,050
<i>Just look around.</i>

385
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:34,773
<i>There's 700 channels on TV,</i>

386
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:38,218
<i>and not a single one of
them is devoted to poetry.</i>

387
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,420
<i>And you've accomplished</i>

388
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:43,422
<i>the greatest achievement
of your career,</i>

389
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:46,385
<i>and seven people
showed up for...</i>

390
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,907
<i>whatever this is.</i>

391
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:51,231
<i>At least I know I don't matter.</i>

392
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:56,835
<i>Oh, that one guy looks
like Javier Bardem.</i>

393
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,236
Blatcher is working

394
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:01,079
in a revolutionary
poetic verbiage

395
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,123
that we see only in...

396
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,778
No!

397
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,819
Come on!

398
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:42,863
That's it, that's it!

399
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:46,144
No. No...

400
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,226
No, I don't want to hear it.

401
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:51,127
Yeah, well, then, you shouldn't have
stayed out late every night for a month.

402
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:53,153
That's not someone
wanting to be with me.

403
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:56,034
How long does it take
to put up chairs?

404
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:57,396
There's, like, 30 chairs,

405
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:58,957
and it takes five
seconds a chair.

406
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,136
That doesn't add up, Russell!

407
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,162
That's just math!

408
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:10,547
Okay, I'm just going
to say something

409
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:13,251
that you don't want to hear.

410
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:16,455
Is it possible that he's
just actually working late?

411
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:19,177
Yeah, but it's "why
is he working late?"

412
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:22,220
It's because he took a
job to be away from me,

413
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,264
just like you're taking a
job to be away from Dad.

414
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,785
That is not...

415
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:27,866
That...

416
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:29,628
That is not why I took this job.

417
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,870
Oh, come on, it's me.

418
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,552
Yes, I know who I'm talking to.

419
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:35,834
Okay, calm down.

420
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:39,478
- You guys are just going through something.
- I get it.

421
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,080
- No, you don't.
- Okay, so you and Dad are just perfect then?

422
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:44,082
No. No, Julie, there
are little things,

423
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:45,403
but they're little things,

424
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,045
and then when there's
a bigger thing,

425
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,448
then we work it out.

426
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,787
Okay, so that's what
you want from me?

427
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,669
- Yeah.
- You want me to work it out with Russell

428
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:55,053
and stay with him, and
then in, like, 25 years,

429
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,655
leave him in a cloud of denial?

430
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:58,699
Oh!

431
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:01,141
Oh, my God. Get in the car.

432
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:03,782
We are going to talk to Russell.

433
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:06,483
No, we're not doing that. We're staying
here. I want to finish the game.

434
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,627
Get in the car.

435
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,671
No!

436
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,527
That was super mature.

437
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:29,728
Come on!

438
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,650
You got it! That's it!

439
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,855
Aw!

440
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:55,073
A little early, no?

441
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,835
It was a disaster.

442
00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:58,917
-What was?
-What was? My talk was.

443
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,961
I'm almost glad
you weren't there.

444
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:02,841
It doesn't matter.

445
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:04,885
I just, I don't even
know where to start.

446
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,126
Can I get the same thing?

447
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,769
Um...

448
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:12,971
start in the middle?

449
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:16,094
I missed a key paper last year.

450
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,595
Everything I was saying about the
neuroscience of moral judgment

451
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:20,258
was apparently made irrelevant

452
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,958
in the third quarter of the
Journal of Neuroscience,

453
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,542
which, in hindsight,

454
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:26,304
may have been a pretty good thing
for me to have been reading.

455
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,986
Well, let's...

456
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:30,669
Let's qualify relevance
here. Relevant to who?

457
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:32,911
I mean, how many people
showed up at this thing?

458
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:34,593
What does that matter?
It was my research.

459
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:37,115
I'm just trying to put
it in perspective, right?

460
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,159
It's not like you lost
a patient on the table.

461
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,883
The whole thing was
extra embarrassing

462
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,605
because I couldn't
even access my notes.

463
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:49,207
There was a virus
on the hotel WiFi.

464
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,612
I heard that was a hoax.

465
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:54,933
Oh, God...

466
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,695
Go on.

467
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:59,097
There's nothing to go on about.

468
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:00,298
It was a nightmare.

469
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,342
I can never come back here.

470
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,545
I think you're wallowing.

471
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:08,707
It wasn't that important
to you yesterday,

472
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,188
or the day before.

473
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,110
I think you're sinking
into your feelings...

474
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,952
Of course it was
important to me yesterday.

475
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:17,115
This has been my work
for the last three years.

476
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:20,639
Your work for the last
three years was getting laid

477
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:23,241
and cheating at racquetball.

478
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,363
I was there, I saw
it. Not the sex.

479
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:28,126
Dude! If that's what you saw,

480
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:30,170
you weren't there at all.

481
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:34,230
Are we... Are we having a
real argument right now?

482
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,734
Because this...

483
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:37,535
This isn't supposed to matter,

484
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:40,178
this academic circle-jerk-a-thon
we come to every year.

485
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,781
I mean, making fun of these guys

486
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:45,583
has been one of the foundational
pastimes of our friendship.

487
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,185
No, it's not.

488
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,387
We make fun of them
for their haircuts.

489
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,431
We don't make fun
of them for caring.

490
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,034
I did, a little.

491
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:57,435
I see that now.

492
00:28:57,477 --> 00:29:00,480
I don't get why.

493
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,561
You've checked out of academia.

494
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,483
You've checked out of writing.

495
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:07,005
You've detached yourself

496
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:10,050
from pretty much
everything you care about.

497
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,051
Every year, you care about less,

498
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,095
and you're more depressed.

499
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:18,618
I just don't see why.

500
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,302
There's other things to
care about than work.

501
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:26,104
I got a wife and a kid.

502
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,684
I know that hasn't worked
out for you. I'm sorry,

503
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,068
but it's damn important to me,

504
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,112
so...

505
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:35,994
Things didn't seem so rosy

506
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:38,038
the other night at
your dinner party.

507
00:29:55,776 --> 00:29:57,615
This is going to be great.

508
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:59,698
You're acting like
we're on a reality show.

509
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,822
My break ends in 10 minutes.

510
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:05,361
Thank you so much for
sitting down with us.

511
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:06,945
You're so welcome.

512
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:09,467
I'm always willing to sit
down and talk things through.

513
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:12,831
- Yeah, for 10 minutes.
- I don't make the bar schedule, okay?

514
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,713
Mr. Travis, he makes
the bar schedule.

515
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:18,236
- The point is I've never seen...
- I've told you so many times...

516
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:19,677
Take a breath!

517
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,138
Take a breath, 'cause we can't
get anywhere if we're hot-headed.

518
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:23,882
I agree.

519
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:27,565
Do you think you can use your calm-down
techniques for every situation?

520
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:29,866
Is this what you do with Dad? Because
I'm beginning to see your fight

521
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,049
from his point of view.

522
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,892
What fight? We are
not having a fight.

523
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,934
Uh, I mean, to be
honest, Mrs. D,

524
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:37,295
from the outside perspective,

525
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,674
it kind of seems like
something's going on.

526
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:40,138
No, absolutely not.

527
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,182
Then why you are kissing
other men at bars?

528
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,542
What?

529
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:45,601
I'll tell you about it later.

530
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,906
How do you know...

531
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:50,268
Okay, I'm sorry, he called
me the other day and told me

532
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,870
when he was in, like,
that crazy panic.

533
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,191
Who did you kiss?

534
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:55,994
Okay, look, your father is
experiencing mental anguish

535
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:59,197
from childhood trauma, so it
actually has nothing to do with me.

536
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:01,479
Oh, my God, that's,
like, very serious.

537
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:02,480
Well, is he seeing
a psychiatrist?

538
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:03,922
No.

539
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,524
- Well, he definitely should be.
- Yeah.

540
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:07,303
Actually, there's this guy
that comes into the bar,

541
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,807
and he's a therapist,

542
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:12,730
but he sees a psychiatrist, like,
for his own problems, right?

543
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:15,151
-He says it's awesome. I can get you his card.
-No, thank you.

544
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:17,936
Can we stop comparing whatever
this is to my marriage?

545
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:19,377
- Again...
- That's so unfair.

546
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,899
Mrs. D, I feel
like you're the one

547
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:22,638
who's kind of not seeing
things clearly here.

548
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:25,103
I support Julie, way more
than Hank supports you.

549
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:27,025
Oh, really? How so?

550
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:30,148
I would go to New York
if Julie wanted me to.

551
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,190
- If you asked me to, I would go.
- Really?

552
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:34,112
Yeah, of course.

553
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:36,514
- That's very nice. Thank you.
- Of course, I'd go.

554
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:37,653
So then, why are you
cheating on her, big shot?

555
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:38,997
- Mom!
- Whoa! I'm not.

556
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,238
Julie thinks otherwise.

557
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,457
- What? I'm so not!
- No, I don't!

558
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,401
- I am so not!
- I know! I believe you!

559
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,963
What?

560
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,542
- I've told her that!
- That's the reason...

561
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:49,407
Then why aren't you
masturbating as much, huh?

562
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,626
- Whoa! Okay, hang on!
- Tell me that!

563
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,370
- Mom!
- You brought it up!

564
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,571
You can't say that to him!

565
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:54,670
You brought it up at the house!

566
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:55,751
- I'm so not!
- I didn't bring that...

567
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:57,055
Why did you bring
that up to her?

568
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,234
You're masturbating
the same amount.

569
00:31:58,258 --> 00:31:59,355
Why would I ever bring that up?

570
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:00,418
You are a traitor!

571
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,820
You need therapy, too!

572
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:03,421
You need... For
real, you need help.

573
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,800
You do need therapy.
You should go to...

574
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:06,264
Couples counselling! Yes!

575
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:08,867
You guys deserve each other. I
think this went really beautifully.

576
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:10,366
Sit down, let's keep
talking about that.

577
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,071
We managed to do that with
eight minutes to spare!

578
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:14,450
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

579
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,476
- Don't leave.
- You drove me here!

580
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,257
I would go to New York with you.

581
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,283
- Would you really?
- Yeah, of course.

582
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:46,224
Give me a moment.

583
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,106
If I'm there more
than 30 seconds,

584
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:50,670
then just say we're
due somewhere.

585
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,831
Hank.

586
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:57,595
Thank you for briefly
stopping by my panel.

587
00:32:57,637 --> 00:32:59,255
For a moment, I thought
you were there to heckle.

588
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,281
Heckle?

589
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:03,041
I'm sorry.

590
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,085
- Uh...
- What?

591
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,087
Well, the turnout, you know.

592
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:10,648
- I mean...
- Oh.

593
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,850
It's tough when the panelists
outnumber the audience.

594
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:14,894
- We've all been there.
- No, not at all.

595
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:17,055
We ran with it,

596
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:19,139
and we turned the
event into a workshop.

597
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,699
It was...

598
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:24,302
It was the most invigorating
conversation I've had in a long time.

599
00:33:24,344 --> 00:33:28,506
I don't know if I'm
just coming into my own,

600
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,628
or the world is
catching up to me,

601
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,510
but I want to wear a T-shirt

602
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,233
that says, "I've been...

603
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,634
here

604
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:39,157
the whole time!"

605
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:41,201
- Maybe I'd use a different meter.
- -Yoo-hoo.

606
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:45,363
See you back at the playground.

607
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:47,407
Congrats on <i>The Atlantic.</i>

608
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:26,524
So, how did it go?

609
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,006
Is Julie still here?

610
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:29,887
They have got issues.

611
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,529
Well, I knew that,
but did she go home?

612
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:33,573
She's not here, is she?

613
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,094
You know what?

614
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:38,896
It's their marriage, and it
has nothing to do with ours.

615
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,539
- Who said it did?
- Nobody,

616
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,743
and I just think

617
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:47,825
that I'm going to
stay out of it.

618
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,165
You know, I think
this generation,

619
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:51,191
they don't...

620
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:55,353
They see marriage
like it's this game

621
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:58,236
where you just say anything
and you do whatever you want,

622
00:34:58,278 --> 00:35:00,798
and you're really
super "over share-y"

623
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,401
about every single
stupid feeling,

624
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:04,762
and all of that

625
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:06,044
is just supposed to, like,

626
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:08,528
fit together into
a relationship.

627
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,130
I don't know what I'm saying,

628
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:15,055
except that thank God,
that's not our marriage.

629
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:19,217
Yeah, okay.

630
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:21,819
Do you know what I mean?

631
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,863
Yeah.

632
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:36,156
You ever feel like you're
right next to your life?

633
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,276
I feel like

634
00:35:38,318 --> 00:35:40,238
I'm watching this guy
who looks like me,

635
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,040
and he's doing all this stuff,

636
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,842
and I just want to tap him
on the shoulder and say,

637
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:47,006
"What's your problem?"

638
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,691
I think I want back in.

639
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:56,976
Respect.

640
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:00,498
All right, well,

641
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,620
you want to start with New York?

642
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,462
Absolutely.

643
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,623
Okay, great.

644
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,985
Um, I've asked for
a four-day week.

645
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:11,269
As for the living arrangements,

646
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:13,271
I found a couple of places

647
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:15,433
that I think are
pretty cute, and...

648
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,515
I need to see my dad.

649
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:19,437
What?

650
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,678
I'm sorry.

651
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,680
I know you were talking,
and I want to hear it,

652
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,802
but I think I need to see
my dad before he leaves.

653
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,124
Eh... I don't know.

654
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,168
I'm going to go.

655
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:36,754
Oh.

656
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,798
It's good to see you.

657
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,878
How's retirement?

658
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,280
Oh, well,

659
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:44,522
it's very new for your
father, of course,

660
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:45,683
and I would say

661
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:49,006
that an academic
never truly retires.

662
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:52,089
Mom, could I just talk
to Dad alone, please?

663
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:54,214
Where exactly am
I supposed to go?

664
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,782
I'll make some tea.

665
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,233
How...

666
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,195
How is your research
coming along?

667
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:19,239
No.

668
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,759
You tell me

669
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,801
what was behind your
decision to move here?

670
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,403
Oh.

671
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:27,525
Well, I recently retired.

672
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,447
The city no longer
felt essential.

673
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:31,609
Okay, but why here?

674
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:33,731
I have family here.

675
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:37,575
We haven't spoken in
person in almost 25 years.

676
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,658
Can we just cut the bullshit
and talk like two adults?

677
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,940
Would you be willing to do that?

678
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:44,984
I am willing.

679
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:47,985
Well...

680
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:50,228
I...

681
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,032
I'm feeling a lot
of stuff right now.

682
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,837
I've gone over this conversation

683
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,440
for years in my head,

684
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:05,443
but I don't really
know where to start.

685
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:07,487
Start in the middle.

686
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,210
I think I might
begin by telling you

687
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,453
how hard it was for me

688
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:18,217
to grow up without a father.

689
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,460
What happened to him?

690
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:26,784
I'm talking about you
leaving your family.

691
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:30,107
When I left, I got
a job at Columbia.

692
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,069
After a string of fellowships,

693
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:36,033
I had the opportunity to
stay at one institution

694
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:38,115
and focus on my research.

695
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:39,997
It was too good to pass up.

696
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,719
Yeah, I don't give a
shit about the job.

697
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:43,200
I mean, I know it
was impressive,

698
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,485
but you left mom and
me for another woman.

699
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:49,246
Oh, yes. Well, that
was a difficult time...

700
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:51,929
Difficult? Was it
difficult for you?

701
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,652
I'm not being glib here,

702
00:39:54,694 --> 00:39:56,213
I actually want to know.

703
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:59,216
How exactly was it
difficult for you

704
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:02,019
when you saw a
child on the floor

705
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:04,063
with a rope around
his neck. Your son...

706
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:08,666
how did that impact you?

707
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,108
And why was the answer to that

708
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,272
to cut off all
contact with your son?

709
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:18,558
Oh, you're talking about Hank?

710
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,440
He was a stubborn child.

711
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:24,484
Strong-willed, demanding.

712
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:30,648
He won't actually
speak to me now.

713
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,371
Did you know that?

714
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:35,853
I'm talking to you right now.

715
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:38,097
Yes, you are.

716
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:41,941
Milk, two sugars, right?

717
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:53,951
Dad, how did you get to town?

718
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,995
Did you come by car or train?

719
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,000
Either way, I arrived.

720
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:03,961
What day of the week is it?

721
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,086
Oh, my God, we both
need a new calendar.

722
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:13,332
How do you like
living in Florida?

723
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:17,415
<i>It's quite pleasant
here in the winter,</i>

724
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:19,377
<i>but...</i>

725
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:20,978
<i>I'll tell you,</i>

726
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,940
<i>summertime,</i>

727
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,545
<i>the humidity is
terrible for books.</i>

728
00:41:29,148 --> 00:41:32,510
<i>Who's the current president?</i>

729
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:35,435
<i>Can we not talk about
politics tonight?</i>

730
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:46,444
What do you want to talk about?

731
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:49,046
Well, I have a new
book coming out,

732
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:51,008
and the publishers
want me to tour

733
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,131
up and down the East Coast.

734
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:57,214
I'm awaiting approval from
the college, of course,

735
00:41:57,256 --> 00:42:00,177
and we might have to delay it

736
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:02,982
until my sabbatical comes up.

737
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:08,786
I wish you luck with that.

738
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:09,867
Thank you.

739
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:12,470
Thank you. I hope
it all works out,

740
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:15,274
but how are things
going for you?
