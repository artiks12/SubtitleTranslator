181
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:21,803
They're gonna need you on this
one. Can I get a ride with you?

182
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,482
Yeah, of course. FOLSOM: Great.

183
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,344
Hey. You sure?

184
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:27,827
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

185
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,724
Okay.

186
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:34,551
[cell phone dings]

187
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,517
Hey, can you grab
my coat there? Yup.

188
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,206
I'll get it for you.

189
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,010
Can you run the footage...
ROBY: Sergeant Wilcox.

190
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,448
The footage when

191
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,793
the protestor first
arrives.Wilcox.

192
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,206
I'm talking to you.

193
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,586
This could be

194
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,413
a terrorist event,
and you sent my people

195
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,034
into the lion's den!

196
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:01,638
Now, one of my best is
headed to the hospital...

197
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,724
I assure you, every
protocol was followed.

198
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:05,206
This has never happened before.

199
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,527
ROBY: I don't want to hear
your excuses. I want this site

200
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,862
checked, triple-checked,

201
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,517
and cleared. I
don't work for you.

202
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,838
No, I don't think you're gonna
be working for LVPD either.

203
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:15,275
Unless you fix it, now.

204
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:21,241
Bring another robot out
to reassess the scene,

205
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:22,344
twice.

206
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,862
I promise it will be safe.

207
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:28,137
Good. 'Cause as soon
as you clear it,

208
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,689
you're gonna be the first one

209
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:32,655
that walks out there,
right next to me.

210
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,275
FINADO: Four bombs?

211
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,148
Did I hear that right?
[stammers] What are we thinking?

212
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,896
Someone has an agenda and
no concern for human life.

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,010
We need to run prints and
DNA on all of these signs.

214
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,517
FINADO: Tortoise
habitat protectors...

215
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,965
That's our suspect pool?

216
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,482
I don't see anyone
walking around

217
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,172
with a manifesto in
their trench coat.

218
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:56,000
Unless the bomber steps forward
and claims responsibility,

219
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,423
the only way we're
gonna find them

220
00:08:57,517 --> 00:08:58,655
is by rebuilding their bomb.

221
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:00,034
They almost always have

222
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:01,344
a signature.

223
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,838
FINADO: What do we
do now... we wait

224
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:03,941
for the little robot to
give us the all clear?

225
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,517
Don't get me started
on that droid.

226
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,655
Medical has set up

227
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:08,241
a triage tent for the victims.

228
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:09,655
Check them all.

229
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,803
Everyone who was at
that party is a piece

230
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,620
of this puzzle.

231
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,448
[indistinct
chatter][siren wailing]

232
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,758
[grunts]

233
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,517
Did you get it out?

234
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,068
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

235
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,793
If Bart's people
don't make this right,

236
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm gonna pay you double time.

237
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:32,448
So it's Shandara Roberts and

238
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,689
Ralph Cicero?

239
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,275
You both knew Bart
Flynn? Of course.

240
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,344
I own the Lucky Stakes.

241
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:41,275
The casino across the street.

242
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,896
Shandara's a pit boss there.

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,103
My best.

244
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,517
So you were working
Bart's party?

245
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
At the Cyan?

246
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:47,965
Mr. Cicero was kind enough

247
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,548
to let a lot of us
have the night off.

248
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,068
Well, I feel sorry
about that now.

249
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,931
You were loaning
employees and partying

250
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,931
with a competitor? I
didn't see it like that.

251
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:57,793
Bart did a lot for this town,

252
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,103
and his new casino here

253
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:02,310
was gonna drive more
business to the region.

254
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:04,206
Forget about the damn tortoises.

255
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,275
That's what I call a
symbiotic ecosystem.

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,079
Well, if you're willing to
help, we might need access

257
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,310
to your exterior
cameras.Anything.

258
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,413
Call me.

259
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,758
RAJAN: What's your name?

260
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:19,068
Rhonda Alvarez.

261
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,827
You're dressed pretty casually

262
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:22,103
for a masquerade party.

263
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,275
Any chance you were protesting?

264
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,655
You have my name.

265
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,941
You'll find out on
all the police reports

266
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,165
we filed against Clint Farley.

267
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:29,862
You can read about
his harassment,

268
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:32,655
how he'd run over our
tents, roll coal at us.

269
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,689
How did you get into the party?

270
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:37,275
You were obviously
close to the blast.

271
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,517
I didn't do this.[scoffs]

272
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,793
I didn't.

273
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,275
But if he's dead,
it's a blessing.

274
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,827
That man was willing to kill
an entire species for cash.

275
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,586
The world is a better
place without him.

276
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,517
Excuse me.

277
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,137
Hi. I'm-I'm Haley Flynn.

278
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,724
Bart Flynn's daughter.

279
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,586
Can I see him?

280
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,689
I'm so sorry.

281
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:11,862
Oh, my God.

282
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,344
I was supposed to be there.

283
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,793
He wanted me there

284
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,241
to blow on the dice while...

285
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:23,689
he dealt craps to, um...

286
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,551
Haley, it's-it's...

287
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,655
Oh, my God.

288
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,862
Can you think of
anyone who might...

289
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,275
Anyone who might
want to kill my dad?

290
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,206
Hurt him, um, or-or his family.

291
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,310
Or his business.

292
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:40,965
His business is people.
That's what he always says.

293
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:44,344
And if he were here...

294
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,689
he'd be helping.

295
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:50,275
He'd want me to help.

296
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,344
Trey. What's going on?

297
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,448
Oh, bro.

298
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,206
Where's Jeanette?

299
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,586
You're filthy, Fols.
You couldn't shower

300
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,103
before coming over?

301
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:14,896
She isn't here, is she?

302
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,482
You pulled me off a bomb site.

303
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,689
This isn't about my
mom at all, is it?

304
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,665
Yo, yo, Jeanette raised
me, too, dude, all right?

305
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,389
Listen, it's the only way
I could get you to answer.

306
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:26,068
Listen, I really
need your help, okay?

307
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:28,310
There's this-this deadbeat,

308
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,000
old friend of mine,
pain in my ass.

309
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:33,517
Just... trying to shake him,
but some people, you know?

310
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:36,103
I get it.

312
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,655
Well, he came around last night,

313
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,758
broke into my apartment.

314
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,068
So call 911, Trey.

315
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:41,769
Yeah, I don't need that
kind of heat, okay?

316
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:42,689
He's bad news.

317
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,448
Will you just... will you...

318
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,275
will you take a look?

319
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,000
Come on.

322
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,689
You killed the guy? No, no, man.

323
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:05,700
It's not like that. You've
been calling me for hours, man.

324
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,884
You've been playing house
with a dead body all morning?

325
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,241
What else were we
supposed to do?

326
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,689
He was like this
when we got home,

327
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:11,907
and I don't know how he got in.

328
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,206
He wasn't here when we left.

329
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,827
So you're saying he-he
broke in and OD'd?

330
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:18,034
Okay, I know it looks bad.

331
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,586
Why do you think I called?

332
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,896
Wait, what are you doing?

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,344
What you should
have done hours ago.

334
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:27,827
I got a 419, a possible OD

335
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,079
at 7119 Eaton ParkwayHey,
what is he doing?

336
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,482
In West Vegas.

Reinforcements are here.

338
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,931
It's about time
you came to see me.

339
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:38,793
Welcome back. Shouldn't
that be my line?

340
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:41,275
Un-retiring agrees with you.

341
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,665
ROBY: All right,
everybody, listen up.

342
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,969
The bomb is the
whole story here.

343
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,034
We find every piece.

344
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:46,862
We rebuild them.
We find our guy.

head on a swivel

We collect, measure,
and swab everything.

348
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:54,379
And I'll buy drinks for anyone

349
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,044
who finds something that
tells us how the bombs

350
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,275
were triggered. Oftentimes,

351
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,758
that's the bomber's signature.

352
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:01,000
Yep. We have heard that.

353
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,344

354
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,137
a scavenger hunt
a-and maybe drinks.

00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,724
I'm in.[chuckles]

00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:10,251
Everybody here,
we're on tent duty.

359
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,172
Got to focus on the
deadly ones first.

360
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:13,458
We sure it's safe
to go in there?

361
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:14,827
Sergeant Wilcox.

362
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,379
Yup.

363
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:20,000
You and me, let's go.Ma'am.

364
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:25,379
We rechecked the tent
and the perimeter.

365
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,103
So, we're good now, right?

366
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:31,103
WILCOX: You're good.
No secondary device.

You didn't find any smokeless
powder at your scene?

381
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,827
Everything here
was covered in it.

382
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,103
No powder, just propane.

383
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:25,551
Got us thinking, I mean,

384
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,355
propane tanks are common
at a construction site.

385
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,339
They use it to fuel forklifts
and welding torches.

386
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,079
We think some of the tanks
might have been caught

387
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:32,586
in the second IED's blast,

388
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:33,724
which would explain why

389
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:34,827
we saw three explosions.

390
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,103
So, what kind of residue

391
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,344
did the second IED leave?

392
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:38,793
None. Maybe the propane

393
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,655
burned off the smokeless
powder over there.

394
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:42,344
Maybe, might have, could have.

395
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:44,551
Those words die in a GC/MS.

396
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:46,379
Tell you what, head
back to the lab

397
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:49,965
test all the shrapnel, find
out what kind of bomb it was.

398
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,137
We've got it handled here.

399
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,793
You know, most people

400
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,517
assume elements of the bomb

401
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,103
vaporize in the blast,

402
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,482
but that's actually
highly unlikely.

403
00:15:58,586 --> 00:15:59,965
You don't say.

404
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:02,655
Explosions only seem
unpredictable until we apply

405
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,172
redux chemistry.

406
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:07,344
Bomb 101. Totally.

407
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,344
It's always good to review.

408
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,655
WILLOWS: Don't you think it's strange
we didn't find any projectiles?

409
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:17,000
There wasn't one nail or screw,
even at the construction site.

410
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,551
Boosting a body count

411
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,724
is usually number one on
a bomber's to-do list.

412
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,307
ROBY: I mean, maybe
they were absorbed.

413
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:24,000
WILLOWS: Maybe. I found pieces

414
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:25,423
of a poker table
at the epicenter.

415
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,862
If the IED

416
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,172
was hidden underneath,

417
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,872
it might have taken the
brunt of the impact.

418
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:32,965
[whoops] Heyo! Drinks on Greg.

419
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,689
You find the receiver?

420
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,310
This isn't the receiver.

421
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:43,068
You found the bomb's detonator.

422
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,655
Shrapnel test number 15.

423
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:48,000
More propane.

424
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,137
[sighs, grunts]

425
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,758
Got to be trace of an
IED in here somewhere.

426
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,689
Um...

427
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:04,689
could you hand me a swab?

428
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:07,550
No fingerprints, no DNA.

429
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:10,448
We're looking at one
careful bomber out there,

430
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,862
or a lucky one.

431
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,275
I don't understand who
would choose a key fob

432
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,137
as a detonator. The
range is only about

433
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:17,310
30 to 50 feet.

434
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,241
The killer, he-he didn't...

435
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:21,241
he-he didn't build
multiple bombs.

436
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,792
There-there was no second bomb.

437
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,493
Second blast was an
accident, just like the third

438
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:25,631
and the fourth. Th-There
was no second bomb.

439
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:26,655
Slow down, Beau.

440
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:27,827
[sighs]

441
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,275
Okay.

442
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,724
I swabbed just about
every piece of shrapnel

443
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,172
until I found this.

444
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:37,689
It's the only projectile at the
second site that had a trace

445
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:38,862
of smokeless powder.

446
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,103
Look, look at it.

447
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,551
Do you see how it's iridescent?

448
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:44,241
Stainless steel turns
iridescent when put under

449
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:45,941
a tremendous amount
of heat and pressure.

450
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,125
That piece of metal was at
the center of the explosion.

451
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:49,620
But you just said there was

452
00:17:49,724 --> 00:17:51,448
no bomb at the second
scene. There wasn't.

453
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:52,965
This is a piece of housing

454
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:54,620
from the IED set
off at the party.

455
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:55,620
In the tent.

456
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:56,620
The first bomb.

457
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,379
I-I think

458
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,448
a piece of shrapnel
from the IED casing

459
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,827
struck the propane tank,
causing it to leak.

460
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,655
Because propane is
heavier than air,

461
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:06,379
the vapor pools were
just waiting there

462
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,655
for something as
insignificant as an ember from

463
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:11,379
the first blast site
to ignite the blaze.

464
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:14,103
So, the second blast was an
accident caused by shrapnel.

465
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:15,931
Why haven't we found
any projectiles

466
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:17,241
from that first IED?

467
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:18,862
I mean, not a bolt,

468
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,758
not a-not a ball bearing.

469
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:24,793
I mean, it's almost like-like
the bomber was, like, try...

470
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,586
Like he was trying to
minimize the body count.

471
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:34,172
Only three dead.
Why use a detonator

472
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,413
with a smaller range unless

473
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,620
you needed to see the blast?

474
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:42,931
If there were not
multiple bombs,

475
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,320
I don't think this
was intended to be

476
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:45,724
a mass casualty event at all.

477
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:48,448
You think the bomber had
a specific target in mind?

478
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,862
And they waited
until that target

479
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,862
was in just

480
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,241
the right position.

481
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,224
The killer was standing
right there in the tent.

482
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,344
And they looked the
victims right in the eye

483
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,413
when they pushed the button.

484
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,953
Dental records confirm your
initial ID's on these guys.

485
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:11,793
Bart Flynn. Clint Farley.

486
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:13,689
Third is Dalton Gray.

487
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:16,551
Gentleman worked on Bart Flynn's
personal security detail.

488
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,724
All exhibit a combination of

489
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:22,206
pulmonary trauma from shrapnel
and blast-induced barotrauma.

490
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,275
Barotrauma. A-As in...

491
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,862
As in barometric.
Uh, barotrauma's

492
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,517
when you're too
close to a blast wave

493
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,103
that decompresses
the air around you.

494
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,275
A sudden pressure
differential between

495
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,965
the air around your body and the

496
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:34,724
gas-containing internal organs,

497
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:36,527
like the G.I. tract, cause
the organs to perforate,

498
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,103
inducing massive hemorrhaging.

499
00:19:38,206 --> 00:19:39,793
I thought...

500
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:42,689
you might want the shrapnel
from each of the victims.

501
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,034
Mostly metal,

502
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:45,355
but about a third of it's wood.

503
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,310
Who knew a table could
do so much damage?

504
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:48,493
You've never seen a
tornado victim, huh?

505
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,000
Splinters at these

506
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:51,620
velocities become bullets.

507
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,413
We have every reason to believe

508
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,724
that one of these
men was the target

509
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,000
of the IED. Who
got it the worst?

510
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,344
Wow.

511
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,241
It's hard to say.

512
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,551
The symmetrical trauma
to the lower half

513
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,517
tells me that they
were all equidistant

514
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,206
and facing the bomb
when it detonated.

515
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,103
None of these guys started off
with a spare foot, did they?

516
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,827
We haven't heard
from the hospital.

517
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,241
Can I just say that I hate

518
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,793
when y'all bring me spare limbs?

519
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,206
The paperwork is weird.

520
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,862
[phone rings]Excuse me.

521
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,758
Busy day.

522
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,310
ROBY: I know it's wrong,

523
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:26,586
but I really wish
one of these guys

524
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,275
was in worse shape
than the other.

525
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:31,827
Oh, so you know
who was the target.

526
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,724
Well, my money's on Clint.

527
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:35,700
Allie said there was a
protestor in the triage tent.

528
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:37,310
Hated Clint with a passion.

529
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:39,527
We should talk to her again
because the detonator's range

530
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,965
puts the bomber in the tent.

531
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,137
In that case,

532
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,241
maybe our guy lost five toes.

533
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,172
ROBY: I wonder if
Detective Chavez

534
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:51,000
has ever had to fit Cinderella

536
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:54,586
[groans]

537
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:56,103
[winces]

538
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:57,896
[groans]

539
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:02,137
Isn't this all kind of a waste
of time? Guy OD'd. There.

540
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,724
Solved it.

541
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,034
I got to get to work, man. Yeah,

542
00:21:06,137 --> 00:21:07,517
and I'm at work, and my job is

543
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,482
to thoroughly investigate
Richie's death.

544
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,103
Uh, if you got places to
go, Trey, you're free to go.

545
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,482
Stacey's good to go, too.

546
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:18,034
All right, awesome.
Thanks, uh, Serena.

547
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,620
Mm-hmm.

548
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:23,655
Way more your vibe
than Allie, bro.

549
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,724
Y-You know Allie?

550
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:30,482
Yeah, Fols introduced
us, few months back.

551
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,068
If that's news, my bad, bro.

552
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:38,000
Yo, tell Allie I say what's up.

553
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,310
[door opens]

554
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:45,862
[door closes]

555
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,458
I see why you keep
that one under wraps.

556
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:49,862
I'm sorry I had to
introduce you today.

557
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,275
It's fine.

558
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,103
Something about
this scene I just

559
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:54,275
don't like.

560
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,068
Yeah.

561
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,517
Me too.

562
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,827
Yeah.

563
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,758
See, I don't like that
you showed up here

564
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,551
instead of going
to the hospital.

565
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,379
I told you, I'm okay.

566
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,896
All right? A friend needed me.

567
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,344
That's all.

568
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:19,310
Have you seen my foot?
What does it look like?

569
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:20,896
We are gonna do
everything we can

570
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,596
to find out who did
this to you, mister...

571
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,413
I'm non-binary.

572
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,068
Van is fine.

573
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:29,620
Van, the deceased are
Bart Flynn, Clint Farley,

574
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,862
and Mr. Flynn's security
guard, Dalton Grey.

575
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:33,482
ROBY: We think that the bomb

576
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,448
was specifically meant
to kill one of them.

577
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:37,827
You were Clint's site
coordinator, correct?

578
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,827
That's right.

579
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:42,344
You don't seem too broken
up about his death.

580
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,137
Yeah.

581
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:45,344
I'm not.

582
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,896
Clint sucked.

583
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,827
He was hostile,

584
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:51,689
he paid people late, created
unsafe work environments.

585
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,148
You know, the only
reason he invited me

586
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,413
to that party was to ream
me out in front of Bart.

587
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,862
ROBY: Right before
the bomb went off.

588
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,034
Walk us through it.

589
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:01,000
Where were you, who'd you see?

590
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,448
It was hard to tell
who was who. I mean,

591
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,689
Everyone was wearing a mask.

592
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,482
Clint put me in charge of
getting rid of the protestors.

593
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,626
You know, it's like he
didn't understand you legally

594
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,344
can't stop people
from protesting.

595
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,620
Okay, so do you recall

596
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,448
where Bart was standing?

597
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,482
Sorry.

598
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,034
It's all a fog.

599
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,206
You remember everything

600
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,896
except where Bart was
standing and what happened

601
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,217
right before the bomb went off.

602
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,413
I'm a victim too, detective.

603
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:31,413
And I'm in a lot of pain.

604
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:34,413
Talking about this
isn't gonna help.

605
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:37,103
GREG: This is really cool.

606
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:40,000
But unless I'm mistaken,
the killer's not in there.

607
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:43,551
Park: No. But right
about here is where

608
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,931
Penny found the detonator,

609
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:47,241
35 feet from the
bomb's epicenter.

610
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,448
No DNA or prints on the key fob.

611
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:52,103
No finding the car owner
and working backwards.

612
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:55,172
I'm sure we could buy that fob
on eBay today if we wanted.

613
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:57,827
What about the masks?

614
00:23:57,931 --> 00:23:59,551
We could run DNA
on all the masks

615
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,448
that were discarded at
the site. You do that,

616
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,758
I could place suspects
in this map, give us

617
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,172
a general idea
where everyone was

618
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,448
when it hit the fan.

619
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:08,206
One of those masks
belonged to our bomber.

620
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,965
Back to basics.

621
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:12,724
To the DNA lab.

622
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:19,379
ROBY: Ooh, you in
here without Joshua?

623
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,172
You'd better put everything
back where you found it.

624
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,034
Mm. He just texted me.
Said he's feeling good.

625
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:27,758
I, on the other hand,
am not feeling so good

626
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:29,724
about reassembling
this poker table

627
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,206
Catherine found
at the epicenter.

628
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,448
It's a good reminder
not to stand

629
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:34,965
directly over an IED, isn't it?

630
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:38,655
Mm. My theory is-is that it
actually housed the bomb.

631
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:40,586
I've been looking for a mount

632
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,862
or some sort of
identifying shrapnel.

633
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:46,620
Wonder why the bomber chose this
poker table to put the bomb in

634
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:48,689
and not one of the
other ones. He didn't.

635
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:50,862
It's not a poker table.
The wood shrapnel I found

636
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:53,551
in Bart Flynn's body... it's
not pine or oak or composite.

637
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:55,827
I found rattan. ROBY: Rattan.

638
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,291
Like what craps
sticks are made of.

639
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,758
This is a craps table.

640
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:02,241
So Bart, the casino
owner, was dealing craps?

641
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:04,144
I mean, his daughter
said that he dealt craps.

642
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,137
It would explain the
rattan blown into his body.

643
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:09,310
He was holding the stick
when the bomb went off.

644
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:10,620
Look at this.

645
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:12,448
It must be his "everyman" act.

646
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:15,275
It says here that Bart always
deals a few game of craps

647
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:16,655
at his appearances.

648
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:20,103
This gap is right where
the dealer was standing.

649
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:22,551
The killer knew exactly
where Bart was gonna be

650
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,275
and waited for him
to get in position.

651
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,517
I think we just found
our intended victim.

652
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:30,034
HALEY: So my dad was, like,

653
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,965
singled out? WILLOWS:
The bomb was placed

654
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:34,206
under the craps table where
your father was dealing.

655
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,137
Everyone knew where
that would be.

656
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,896
He was the most powerful
man in the room.

657
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,689
He stepped on a lot of toes.

658
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,689
Do you have any idea who, um...

659
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:48,862
We have a few suspects.
Not sure if you're aware,

660
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,896
but the party was
infiltrated by protestors.

661
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,724
Protestors have been there
since we broke ground.

662
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:56,241
Poor Mr. Cicero
across the street

663
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:57,965
and his dinky little casino.

664
00:25:58,068 --> 00:26:00,000
He offered to rename
it the Lucky Tortoise

665
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:03,379
if they'd just go away, but,
God, those people are rabid.

666
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:06,068
[sniffles]

667
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,344
Haley, uh...

668
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:10,172
you broke a nail.

669
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,379
I lost it helping

670
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:16,586
set up for-for the party.

671
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:18,758
I'm just too hands-on, clearly.

672
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:20,724
You told me you didn't
go to the party.

673
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:26,206
I, uh, I misspoke.

674
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,275
I did go to help oversee
the party's setup,

675
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,827
but I only could only
stay for a few minutes.

676
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,517
I wanted to stay. I-I
really wanted to stay.

677
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,620
Okay, hon. It's gonna be okay.

678
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,172
We just have to
follow all leads.

679
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,931
If you need to speak to me
again, you can call my lawyer.

680
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,310
You've made a
beautiful bomb, Chris.

681
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:02,103
It's just a big physics problem.

682
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,448
Smokeless black powder has
a combustion coefficient

683
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:06,000
of base three.

684
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:08,000
Our 22-foot blast radius
tells us approximately

685
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:11,172
eight ounces were used, and
bing, bong, bing. Shockwave.

686
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:12,862
It's just simple
math. Well, the bomber

687
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,941
might not have run your
numbers, but they must have had

688
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,251
some idea how big
this was gonna be.

689
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,206
Which is why I think
he was standing

690
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,862
right there. Eyeline to
Bart Flynn. Close enough

691
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:23,113
to the detonator they
dropped, far enough away

692
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:25,862
they could get away unscathed.

693
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:27,379
Who said they were unscathed?

694
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:29,068
Okay, minimally scathed.

695
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:31,724
Bart Flynn's daughter
Haley broke a nail.

696
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,103
She's only one suspect.

697
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:34,965
Rhonda, the
party-crashing protestor,

698
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:36,793
was hit by shrapnel.
Van lost a foot.

699
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:38,103
But the detonator

700
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:41,275
was found on the other
side of the room,

701
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:43,620
opposite Van's foot.
I don't like 'em.

702
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:45,827
Where was Haley? Hard to say.

703
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,517
She said she broke a
nail earlier in the day.

704
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,379
But we've got a small
army running the masks.

705
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:55,103
With any luck, we'll have
more names on here soon.

706
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,931
There she is.

707
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,172
Uh...

708
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:03,206
Hawaiian pizza.

709
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,724
Are you sure you're
not concussed?

710
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,482
[chuckles]

711
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:10,620
It's a theme. I got
some PTO I got to use,

712
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,379
and I was thinking...

713
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,206
me, you, Maui.

714
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:19,896
That could be fun.

715
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,862
I just said the word Maui,
and you didn't blink.

716
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:25,241
What's going on?

717
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:30,103
I let it drop yesterday
since y... you almost

718
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:31,724
died, but

719
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,034
why did you tell Allie about

720
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,620
running prints for
Trey and not me?

721
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,241
I-I didn't tell Allie,
she was just there

722
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:40,000
when Trey showed up.
Uh, it wa... It...

723
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,586
Honestly, it wasn't a big deal.

724
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,896
You and I had only been
together a couple months, and...

725
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,068
it just never came up.

726
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,896
Uh, well, I remember
Trey calling.

727
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,379
We talked about him.

728
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:52,655
Yeah, and you told me that

729
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,206
I should cut him out of my life.

730
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,689
And, look...

731
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:58,000
I wish it was that simple.

732
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,862
Okay. Maybe it's not.

733
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,689
Just don't cut me out.

734
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,103
[phone dings]

735
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,689
Ooh, dead guy on Trey's couch.

736
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:10,448
Just got his record.
WLVU dropout,

737
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:11,862
a few unpaid parking tickets.

738
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,275
That's it.

739
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,827
Doesn't really sound
like the villain

740
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:17,034
that Trey made him out to be.

741
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:22,068
Do you know more about Trey
than you're letting on?

742
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:25,344
No, but... I don't think

743
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,068
that Richie broke
into his apartment.

744
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:29,448
I think he was there to score.

745
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,562
Josh, if you think Trey's a
dealer, you have to report that.

746
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:35,379
Well, I don't have any evidence,
and-and if I seek a warrant,

747
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,068
then there's no
un-ringing that bell.

748
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,896
I know you want to protect
your friend, I-I get it.

749
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,862
But I don't want
you getting burned.

750
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:47,517
So, what are you gonna do?

751
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,034
Not too shabby, Mr. Finado.

752
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,697
Your bomb housing's
coming along nicely.

753
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,993
I'm starting to think we got
a pipe bomb minus the pipe.

754
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,517
There's no end
caps. And at first,

755
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,896
I thought this was lock
was part of a slot machine.

756
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,172
I just watched
Chris' simulation.

757
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:08,355
There were no slot machines
near the epicenter.Right.

758
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,344
Got me thinking. What
if it wasn't a pipe,

759
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:12,931
but a money box, like one
of those metal toke boxes

760
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,310
found in gaming tables?

761
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:18,137
A bomber could turn a
toke box into a pipe bomb

762
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:19,896
just by welding it shut.

763
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,517
I mean, it's a pretty clever way
to hide a bomb in plain sight.

764
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,241
If I'm right, whoever had
access to that toke box...

765
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:27,217
I'm pretty sure they're the
ones who placed the bomb.

766
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:30,413
There might be a way
to pull prints off

767
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,034
of this blackened mess.

768
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:34,137
Have you heard of liquid latex?

769
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:36,827
Have I heard of liquid latex?

770
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:43,344
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of it.

771
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,793
I was showering.

772
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:54,000
Sorry. Is Trey here?

773
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,344
He's at work.

774
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:57,172
I can wait.

775
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:02,793
Fine. As long as you promise
not to join me in the shower.

776
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,344
I promise.

777
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:10,586
The couch is there.

778
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,344
Ah.

Yeah, that's

We'll take it from

Shandara. You are a difficult
woman to get in touch with.

792

Well, I'm sorry.
It's just, uh...

I don't really want
to relive that night.

I assume that's
what this is about?

795

The bomb at Bart Flynn's
party was housed in a toke box

796
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,517
placed at his craps table.
And you were pit boss

797
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,137
that night, in charge of
collecting money, and your...

798
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,561
your prints were
all over the box.

799
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,482
Well, were mine the
only prints on it?

800
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:27,586
We don't know that, but we
know you had access to it.

801
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:29,103
Well, of course I did.

802
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:31,241
But a lot of people had
access to toke boxes.

803
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:33,655
Uh, my croupier, Ms. Flynn.

804
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,724
Haley Flynn?

805
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,413
Ms. Flynn says that she
left before the event.

806
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:41,103
And no one has
challenged her story,

807
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:42,482
and no one saw her.

808
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,379
Well, I did. She was
in a worker's mask.

809
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:47,896
A worker's mask?

810
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,344
Staff wear black masks to
distinguish us from guests.

811
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,931
I wouldn't have
realized it was her,

812
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:57,275
but then she took her mask
off and threw it away.

813
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:59,793
She threw her mask away?
Right on the ground.

814
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,241
Spoiled brat.

815
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:04,137
How many masks are
waiting to be tested?

816
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:08,103
Okay, only 23
worker masks to go.

817
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:10,275
Anyone seen Catherine?

818
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:12,079
She wanted me to run
background on Haley Flynn.

819
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,517
What you got? Ms.
Flynn set a lab on fire

820
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,355
in college because they
were testing on animals.

821
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:19,172
Daddy covered for her.

822
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:22,000
And she's major donor
to A Home for Tortoises,

823
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,482
Rhonda Alvarez's company.

824
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,172
Haley was at the masquerade
party masquerading

825
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:29,413
as a worker. Got
her DNA right there.

826
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:32,310
So, Haley and Rhonda
were in on this together?

827
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:33,813
We had the wrong
motive. Right lady.

828
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,241
Looks like daddy's little
girl didn't kill for money.

829
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:38,689
She killed for a cause.

830
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,689
You think I killed my father
because of a fingernail?

831
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,482
We didn't find any
DNA on the fingernail.

832
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,172
We did find a worker's
mask with your DNA on it.

833
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:54,620
CHAVEZ: You lied to us about

834
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:55,838
being at your father's party.

835
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:57,142
You also have a history of arson

836
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:58,724
and association
with Rhonda Alvarez.

837
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:00,310
This is crazy.

838
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,379
I did not plant a bomb
to kill my father.

839
00:34:03,482 --> 00:34:05,310
Then why were you at the party?

840
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,827
I care about Rhonda's cause.

841
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,757
And my dad, he couldn't
care less about the effects

842
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:17,482
this new casino would
have on the environment.

843
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:19,516
I just wanted to
make him listen.

844
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,827
So you let Rhonda
in so she could

845
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,447
kill your father? I let Rhonda
in to disrupt the party.

846
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:27,655
She didn't tell me she
was gonna blow it up.

847
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:30,518
I didn't think that she... I'm gonna
advise my client to stop talking.

848
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,344
Yeah, it's a little
too late for that.

849
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,631
You're under arrest, Ms. Flynn.

850
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,793
Hands behind your back.

851
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:39,068
No, please. Please.
I didn't do this.

852
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,310
Hit it.Okay.

853
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:05,827
Methamphetamines
laced with levamisole.

854
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:08,586
That's that medication
they use to treat animals

855
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,793
with parasitic worms.

856
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:12,758
Is the source of
these drugs that OD?

857
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:15,172
Uh, w... Yeah, the, uh,

858
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:17,517
the vic, Richie... he
was cranked full of meth,

859
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,310
but it was the levamisole
that killed him.

860
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,689
According to the tox
report, he... Mm.

861
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:23,724
He was allergic.Mm.

862
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:26,793
Any reason there's no
case number on here?

863
00:35:26,896 --> 00:35:29,689
Huh? What's going on?

864
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, I, um...
Listen, in order...

865
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,896
Just stop. Just stop.

866
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,862
For the sake of
argument, let's say

867
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:40,758
that you were running tests,

868
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:44,827
off the books, on a case
involving your friend.

869
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:48,413
This isn't off the books.
I-I did start a case.

870
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:51,103
You ran it three times,
Joshua. It's positive.

871
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:55,551
You have double confirmation,

872
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:58,965
you have the drugs linked
to a presumed drug dealer.

873
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:00,206
Mm.

874
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,241
And a dead guy in a room.

875
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:08,241
Max... You gonna run
it a fourth time?

876
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:15,482
You are a loyal friend, Joshua.

877
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:19,586
But now would be a good time
for you to remember who you are.

878
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,517
SANDERS: We found no trace

879
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,862
of smokeless powder on
Haley or Rhonda's hands.

880
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:28,241
Yeah, we need more.So...

881
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:30,724
we spoke to the
slot route operator

882
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:33,379
who supplied the casino
equipment for the party.

883
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,000
Let me guess, not his toke box.

884
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,206
A big no.

885
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,137
But he did say each
lock comes with

886
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,586
its own proprietary
non-duplicate key.

887
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:44,655
So the missing key will be...

888
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:47,068
Key? If we can
reverse engineer it,

889
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:50,517
the manufacturer should be able
to tell us where the lock sold.

890
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,000
If we can find where Rhonda
or Haley bought that toke box,

891
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:55,517
we got her.

892
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,379
Beau is with a locksmith now.

893
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,206
Still sharp, Greg-o.

894
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,793
Sounds like you
got this handled,

895
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:04,413
so, what am I here for? Advice.

896
00:37:04,517 --> 00:37:07,379
You know I've always
trusted your opinion.

897
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:10,206
I love the new
hairstyle. I'd keep it.

898
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,241
Thanks. I like yours, too,
but this is about work.

899
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:17,862
I'm almost kind of
halfway thinking

900
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:20,379
I should come back
here full time.

901
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:22,689
I mean, the hours aren't great,

902
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:25,793
but forensics is
in my DNA.And what?

903
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:27,620
What's the other
part of you want?

904
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:30,448
I've already written five books.

905
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:31,827
I love to share what I know.

906
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:34,758
It's scary to contemplate
a third career,

907
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:37,172
but I'm thinking about
going to grad school

908
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:39,275
to become a professor.

909
00:37:39,379 --> 00:37:42,448
Well, you have been
trying to teach

910
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,448
the new kids all week.

911
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:48,310
Imagine how much fun it would
be with actual students.

912
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,693
Hey, we got a match on the lock.

913
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:51,148
We just need to make sure
it's the right person.

914
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:52,424
Greg, do you want
to help me in Trace?

915
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:57,000
Dr. Gregory Hojem Sanders.

916
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:59,206
Go get 'em, Doctor.

917
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:18,965
Remember giving us this?

918
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:21,620
WILLOWS: Did you know that
smokeless powder residue

919
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:24,000
lingers in the user's
sweat long after use?

920
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:28,620
BEAU: We found a mix of your DNA
and smokeless powder on the card.

921
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,275
That was after the locksmith

922
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:31,907
linked the lock that we
found at the bomb's epicenter

923
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,586
to your casino.

924
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,413
You built and planted
a bomb in the tent

925
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:38,068
to kill Bart Flynn, Ralph.

926
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:40,724
[indistinct chatter]

927
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:42,413
You waited for him
to get into position,

928
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:45,000
and then... boom.

929
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,620
[people screaming]

930
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,758
The power of the bomb
surprised you, huh?

931
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:51,310
You left your detonator behind.

932
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,758
[scoffs] I...

933
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:55,137
I'm a businessman.
I'm not a...

934
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,413
I'm not... I'm not a maniac.

935
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:01,655
You're not a gun owner
is what you're not.

936
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,655
You have no weapons
registered in your name,

937
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,517
so can you think of an
explanation as to why

938
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,931
you had smokeless powder

939
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:10,965
on your hands?

940
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:19,068
I've fought vultures like

941
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,068
Bart Flynn for decades.

942
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,068
You didn't want neighbors.

943
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:27,137
Lucky Stakes may not be fancy.

944
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:30,793
My little corner of the
desert may not be much,

945
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,068
but it's mine!

946
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,034
You used the
protestors as patsies.

947
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:37,172
You wanted Haley to
inherit her father's land

948
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,596
because you knew she
would never build a rival

949
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,344
to your casino.

950
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:44,931
You can't make it in
the casino business

951
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:48,137
if you don'’t know
all the angles.

952
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:52,241
HALEY: I guess the house
doesn't always win.

953
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,251
Could have told you Ralph was
a freak if you just asked.

954
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:58,000
You knew Ralph didn't want
you to build a casino.

955
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:02,000
No one wanted my dad
building that casino.

956
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,965
He said it was for me.

957
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,137
As if I needed a
bigger inheritance.

958
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:11,000
But it was all for his ego.

959
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:12,586
His big dream.

960
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:14,137
And you're not gonna
build his dream

961
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:16,241
in his honor, are you?

962
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:17,827
So, Ralph Cicero

963
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:20,620
gets what he wants after all.

964
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,379
I don'’t know.

965
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:25,689
I mean, did he want
to die in prison?

966
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:47,689
What couldn't be said
on the phone, man?

967
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,493
Stacey called, man. They're
searching the place.

968
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:50,517
You got to stop 'em.

969
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,862
Trey, I'm not gonna do that.

970
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:57,344
Oh, wow. [short chuckle]

971
00:40:57,448 --> 00:41:00,172
You called it in, didn't you?

972
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,517
Trey...

973
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,413
I trusted you.Trey.

974
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:06,482
Damn it!

975
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:08,241
Trey, Richie wasn't
a bad kid, man,

976
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:10,275
he was just lost, and you
took advantage of that.

977
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:13,068
Richie was a grown-ass man,
man. He made his choices.

978
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,827
And you made yours, and it's
called drug-induced homicide.

979
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,206
You forget who you are, man.

980
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,827
Being around you makes me
forget who I've become.

981
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,724
You see, this is why
Jeanette doesn't trust you.

982
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,620
Your own mother doesn't
trust you. You know,

983
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:33,838
she told me not to talk
to you, [car approaching]

984
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:34,758
but I didn't want
to believe her.

985
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:36,172
You want to know wh...

986
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,965
You didn't just
call for a search.

987
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:43,758
No, I didn't.

988
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,931
You're going in, man.

989
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,655
Oh, you want to add assaulting
an officer to your charges?

990
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:53,103
Go ahead, man.

991
00:41:54,275 --> 00:41:56,000
Take him. Hands
behind your back.

992
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:59,517
I was your brother, Fols.

993
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:03,310
Hey.

994
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:05,000
Hey!

995
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:08,103
This how you treat
family?! Let's go.

996
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:11,137
I was your brother!
