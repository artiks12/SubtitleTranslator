1
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,654
And you just need to sign here,

2
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,576
and here, and here.

3
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,038
Not that it makes a difference,
but what is it that I'm signing?

4
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,005
in case you fail to provide my client
with a suitable male heir.

5
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,298
- Suitable?
- No femmes or fatties.

6
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,635
This is insane.

7
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,428
How are you okay with this?

8
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,931
Kratt is a murderer.
He's holding Josh hostage.

9
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,849
Now, you listen to me, young lady--

10
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,519
And just to be clear,
we're basically the same age.

11
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,313
When I became a lawyer, I took an oath.

12
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,649
An oath called attorney-client privilege.

13
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,609
Which means if someone gives me money,

14
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,362
whatever they've done
or may do one day doesn't matter.

15
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,365
Bobby, how's it coming?

16
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,368
All good, Mr. Kratt.
Everything's signed and legally binding.

17
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,287
Wonderful.
You know how I feel about the law.

18
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
That it exists to protect you
and only you.

19
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,874
Exactly.

20
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,585
Thank you, Bobby. You are free to leave.

21
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,878
Ten dollars?

22
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,173
Girl, be corrupt but have some pride.

23
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,760
Hello, my sweet. How are you?

24
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,264
- Honestly, not great.
- Wedding day jitters.

25
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,892
Don't worry. That dress will look
much better when you're standing up.

26
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,103
Where is Josh? If you hurt him--

27
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,188
Mr. Skinner will remain unharmed

28
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,524
as long as you do
everything you've been asked to do.

29
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:20,821
Once we're pronounced man and wife,
he will be released, and then...

30
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,034
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, don't you dare sing to me, you sicko!

31
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,704
I shut down a dream ballet!
I will shut down this!

32
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,998
Stop the music! Stop!

33
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,296
But unfortunately, that someone isn't me.

34
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,424
My heart belongs to Josh,
and it always will,

35
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,093
and there's nothing you can do
to change that.

36
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,472
The wedding is in one hour.
See you at the altar.

37
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,558
Frau.

38
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,319
Maybe I was once,
but that was a long time ago.

39
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,571
I did what I had to do to survive.

40
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,448
I recommend you do the same.

41
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,784
Mr. Kratt is the wealthiest man
in Schmicago.

42
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,955
You will be comfortable, taken care of.

43
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,792
And in a place like this,
that's not nothing.

44
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,092
So, you see... ...we actually didn't even want to be here.

45
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,303
We were just trying
to get back to Schmigadoon.

46
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,847
It's kind of funny
when you think about it.

47
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,602
You enjoyed your freedom while you had it.

48
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,230
Now it's time you pay your dues
like the rest of us.

49
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,774
- Like the rest of you?
- Guys like you are lucky.

50
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,819
You and your hippie friends,
you get to live however you like

51
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,906
while slobs like me
get stuck doing all the work.

52
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,284
What's stopping you
from living the life you want?

53
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,752
Hello. Uncle Octavius.

54
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,504
There's been a slight change of plans.

55
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,298
After the wedding,
you need to kill Mr. Skinner.

56
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,471
But I thought the plan was to release him.

57
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,556
Plans change.

58
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,807
You need to kill him.

59
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,185
It will make it easier
for my new bride to move on.

60
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:20,941
Okay. But if I do, will I finally get
my own act at the club like you promised?

61
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,652
I-I don't know
if you saw my latest proposal, but--

62
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,071
Kill him.

63
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,165
What was that about?

64
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,877
Wrong number.

65
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,588
You literally said, "Uncle Octavius."

66
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,550
So now you're just going to kill me?

67
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,886
I'm sure you've got things in your job
you don't like.

68
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,387
Don't do this.

69
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,431
It's not worth it.

70
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,184
- Uncle Octavius will make it worth it.
- How do you know?

71
00:07:55,184 --> 00:08:00,439
Because he's been promising me
for the past 36 years. That's how.

72
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:06,612
S-- Have you ever heard of
the Parable of the Faithful Servant?

73
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,946
- The what?
- Mmm.

74
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,116
There once was a faithful servant

75
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,829
who served a cruel master.

76
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:21,293
The master kept asking the servant
to do things for him

77
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,340
that the servant knew in his heart
w-were wrong.

78
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,384
But he did them
because he had been promised

79
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,679
that he would inherit all of
his master's riches when he died.

80
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,183
But when the master finally died,
the servant discovered

81
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:42,105
that he left everything to his new
totally age-inappropriate wife.

82
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:49,029
And the servant ended up with nothing
but his own broken dreams.

83
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,324
The end.

84
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,082
I see what you're trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.

85
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,793
Besides, it's too late for me.

86
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,337
It's never too late
to follow your dreams, man.

87
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,594
Have you heard the parable of
the guy who helped the other guy,

88
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,638
and it worked out for both of them?

89
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,976
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Fill up those tummies.

90
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,064
I need an orphan! Now!

91
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,694
- But the plan.
- The plan failed.

92
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,781
That devil Kratt
has eluded my grasp once again.

93
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,408
Mercy, what happened?

94
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,243
What happened? He's alive.

95
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,829
My Daisy's dead.

96
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,874
My blade requires blood.

97
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,625
So, who wants to go first?

98
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,460
Now, now. Let's not get hasty here.

99
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,462
- Let's wait until--
- No more waiting!

100
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,716
You claim to be devoted to me,
Miss Codwell.

101
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,343
Well, now's the time to prove it.

102
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,401
God, that was good.

103
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:10,986
Come with me.

104
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,698
Nap time! Everybody needs a nap! Now!

105
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,782
Do as you're told.

106
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,685
What do you want?

107
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,230
- Is everything okay?
- We heard screaming.

108
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,481
Did that man harm you?

109
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,774
Are you in danger?

110
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,234
Why'd you call him daddy?

111
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,238
No, I'm fine. We're fine.

112
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:58,033
Go back to your rooms.
No one's in any danger.

113
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,662
Actually, that's not quite true, my sweet.

114
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,500
Last night, I saw Mr. Skinner
being taken at gunpoint

115
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,961
by that crooked policeman, Rivera.

116
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,842
How can we help him?
We don't even know where he is.

117
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:22,599
The same place Rivera took me
20 years ago for questioning.

118
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,103
The basement of Kratt's power plant.

119
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,898
You may get to kill someone yet.

120
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,441
Well, if providence is kind.

121
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,238
That was amazing.

122
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,789
It's so nice for once to get to be
the student instead of the teacher.

123
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,169
Do you think there's even more
for me to learn about lovemaking?

124
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,837
Yeah, definitely.

125
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,631
It was great.

126
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,720
But, you know, even--
even Picasso kept taking lessons.

127
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,723
You know, there's always,
uh, more to learn.

128
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,146
- Go away!
- Come on.

129
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,610
Well. At least you're still getting naked.

130
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,694
What do you want?

131
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,822
Shouldn't you be out
following your new chosen leader, Josh?

132
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,157
Josh is in trouble.

133
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,117
Sergeant Rivera took him
to the power plant

134
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,203
so they can force Melissa to marry Kratt.

135
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,205
- We obviously don't care about Melissa...
- No.

136
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,250
...but we didn't know what to do,
so we came to you.

137
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,087
It's true Josh hurt me.

138
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,425
But sometimes, when your face
has been slapped,

139
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,429
you need to turn the other cheek
and let that person slap you again.

140
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,682
- But do you?
- Yeah, that sounds bad.

141
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,851
- Yeah, not the best example, darling.
- Oh.

142
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,521
But no matter what he did,
Josh is still our chum.

143
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,565
And if he needs our help, then we need to
be there for him no matter what.

144
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,860
You better gas up the happiness bus.
It's on.

145
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,529
Yes!

146
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,655
Let's roll.

147
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,744
And not only did Sloth set Chunk free
and get revenge on his evil family,

148
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:10,958
but he became friends with all the Goonies
and shared in their bounteous fortune.

149
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,544
- The end.
- Good.

150
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,843
Start one more parable
and I'll kill you right now.

151
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,469
No, you won't.

152
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,098
Let Josh go now.

153
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,015
Topher?

154
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,059
Josh. I'm so sorry, man.

155
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,853
A sour macaroon?

156
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,271
I don't even know what that means.

157
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,314
No worries. I love you, man.

158
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,275
- I love you too, man.
- Oh, brother.

159
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,612
If it isn't our troupe of
strolling fruitcakes come to save the day.

160
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,115
With what? Love?

161
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,951
Nice try. I've got this.

162
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,035
Wait.

163
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,206
Love is stronger than any gun.

164
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,457
Are you sure about that?

165
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,251
I'm not sure about that, no.

166
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,755
That's right, copper.

167
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,593
- And who the hell are you?
- You don't recognize me, Sergeant Rivera?

168
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,720
Well, I suppose I can't blame you.

169
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,724
It has been 20 years
since you sent me to prison

170
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,476
for the murder of my wife, Daisy.

171
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,562
Dooley Blight?

172
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,646
In the flesh.

173
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,150
And thirsty for revenge.

174
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,693
Wait.

175
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,363
Daisy was my mother's name.

176
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,410
Hello, my daughter.

177
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,494
No.

178
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,163
I have no father.

179
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:35,083
Jenny. Jenny, believe me,
I never harmed your mother.

180
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,503
I loved her more than life itself.

181
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,506
I wish I could believe that, but I don't.

182
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,759
I want nothing to do with you.

183
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:48,096
Then I may as well
leave this hell for the next.

184
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,057
- No!
- Stop! Stop!

185
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,646
He's telling the truth.

186
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,190
And I know...

187
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,693
because I'm the one who framed him.

188
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,073
Kratt killed your mother, not Dooley.

189
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,177
Who wants to help me stop a wedding?

190
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,387
I do!

191
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,229
Do you, Octavius, take Melissa
to be your lawful wedded wife?

192
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,192
I do.

193
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,445
Do you, Melissa, take Octavius
to be your lawful wedded husband?

194
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,906
I have no choice.

195
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,325
That counts!

196
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,245
Then by the power vested in me
by the city of Schmicago,

197
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,663
I pronounce you ma--

198
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,540
- Stop the wedding!
- Josh!

199
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,958
You. How did you--

200
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,836
You need to shut your stupid mouth
and get away from my wife.

201
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,464
- Seize him.
- What?

202
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,633
Officers, stand down!

203
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,218
What do you think you're doing?

204
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,721
Standing up to you. For once.

205
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,848
And so am I.

206
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,683
Enough is enough, Octavius!

207
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,145
I'm afraid the two of you
have overplayed your hand.

208
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,772
They don't answer to you.
They answer to me.

209
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,570
I love you, Mel!
And I'm so sorry for this whole mess!

210
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,489
I love you too! No matter what happens,
I'll always love you!

211
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,409
Enough of this prattle.
Pronounce us man and wife.

212
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,372
By the power vested in me by the city of
Schmicago, I now pronounce you--

213
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,208
- Vengeance!
- Dooley Blight?

214
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,502
- Is mine!
- No, Daddy, no!

215
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,104
You just keep on losing,
don't you, Blight?

216
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,319
Not so fast, my sweet.

217
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,614
Finish the ceremony.

218
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:15,577
Mr. Kratt, as your lawyer, I must advise--
Myself to sit back down.

219
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,119
Finish it!

220
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,166
Okay, um, then by the power vested in me
by the city Schmicago,

221
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,794
- I pronounce you man and--
- Look up!

222
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,342
Oh, shit.

223
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,728
Seriously? Again?

224
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,023
It really is a wonderful knife.

225
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,403
My love.

226
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,408
- Are you all right? - Yeah, I am now.

227
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,451
- I love you.
- I love you.

228
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,164
Is he dead?

229
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:45,959
Now that Kratt is dead, things are
about to change in Schmicago.

230
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,505
Madam Frau will take over the club

231
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,591
and use her position
to promote exciting new talent.

232
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,440
Like ex-Sergeant Rivera.

233
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,819
Bobby will team up with the tribe
to split up Kratt's monopolies,

234
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,280
and something incredible will happen.

235
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,450
They all get jobs!

236
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,790
While Topher and Jenny will find
the perfect home for their talents

237
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,458
at the orphanage.

238
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,840
Because Miss Codwell and Dooley
will go into business together

239
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,009
and make a killing.

240
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:41,223
So, Josh and Melissa now finally have
the happy ending they've been seeking

241
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,685
and are free to leave Schmicago and go
back to their world.

242
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,769
But why would they?

243
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:51,066
Why return to a place
you were so desperate to leave?

244
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,862
Where bad people triumph,
good people suffer,

245
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:57,906
and some couples,
no matter how badly they want it,

246
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,909
will never ever have children?

247
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,788
Sure, you-- You probably feel
like you've learned something

248
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,582
on your brief sojourn here.

249
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:10,544
And now life is gonna be so much better.
Right?

250
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,138
Didn't you feel that way
when you left Schmigadoon?

251
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,640
That you had gotten your happy ending,

252
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,518
that everything was gonna be okay
from here on out?

253
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,104
But it wasn't, was it?

254
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,440
The magic wore off.

255
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:36,403
Magic always does,
except here in Schmicago.

256
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,456
- Here you could be a star.
- A beloved leader.

257
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,627
Here all of your dreams
can actually come true.

258
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,764
Thanks to you, things are
getting better here for all of us.

259
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,225
You can't leave now.
Things are just getting good!

260
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,269
Add 'em up, kiddos. Add 'em up.

261
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,276
So, what's it gonna be?
The joyless drudgery of life out there?

262
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,571
Or the magic and excitement here?

263
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,078
What are you thinking?

264
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,497
What are you thinking?

265
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,753
I think...

266
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,194
More what?

267
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,865
More uncertainty? More joylessness?

268
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:28,640
The only place you're gonna get
what you really want is here.

269
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,851
All of you.

270
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,312
But it's time for us to go.

271
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,065
Are you sure?

272
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:22,319
It's gonna be a constant struggle
with more bad days than good ones.

273
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,113
And a very good chance you'll end up
right back where you were.

274
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:26,990
We know.

275
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,335
You did it! You did it! I knew you would!
I knew you had it in you!

276
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,503
What?

277
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,924
I'm so sorry putting you through all this.
I really am, but I had to test you.

278
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,718
And you passed the test, didn't ya!

279
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,806
Wait, you're smiling? Why are you smiling?

280
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,850
- Because he works for me.
- For you?

281
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,644
Yeah, about that.
I'm not doing this narrator gig no more.

282
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,188
I'm tired of helping people
figure out their lives.

283
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,233
I want a life of my own! With romance!

284
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:03,652
And it's gonna be with... him.

285
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,530
I don't hate it.

286
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,285
And that's the moment
the Narrator's life changed.

287
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,621
Okay, I'm happy for you.

288
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,789
Thank you.

289
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,333
So, can we go home now?

290
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,920
You can go home, yes, you can go home,
but that's just the beginning!

291
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,299
What's more important
is what you'll take with you when you go!

292
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,469
Wait a minute. Is-- Isn't that--

293
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,679
My brother.

294
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,640
He's a little more traditional than I am,
but I still love the guy.

295
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,851
- Shall we, Oscar?
- Of course, Steve.
