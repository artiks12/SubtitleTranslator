1
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,857
Sam was here all the time.
No one loves the music like her.

2
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,530
For Sam, it's a religion.

3
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:01,538
Doesn't matter how crowded it is,
she always finds her way to the front.

4
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,510
She never missed a show.
Every night was better than the last.

5
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,929
The night of the 4th,
a band was playing here, called Ex Nihilo.

6
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,287
You see Samantha?

7
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:51,588
Yeah, but she didn't stay
for the show, which was unlike her.

8
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,526
Must've had somewhere
real important to be.

9
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,135
Said she was going uptown,
but she'd be back.

10
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,556
But I didn't see her again. Is she okay?

11
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,788
Was Samantha alone when she came by?

12
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,105
With a young dude.

13
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,501
He went inside. Not sure when he left.

14
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,611
Size 28 jeans?
Type of guy who might piss himself?

15
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,172
Sounds about right.

16
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,091
You think you can describe him
to a sketch artist?

17
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,051
Bet you make it a habit to remember faces.

18
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,368
But not talk to cops.

19
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,795
Come by the station. No one has to know.

20
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,973
Hey, Charlie. You're awake.

21
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,018
You mean conscious?

22
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,831
After being knocked unconscious
by your boyfriend?

23
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,125
Okay, Sol didn't hit you that hard.

24
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,735
Trust me. Think you were mostly tired.

25
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,782
I'm also missing my
cell phone and my wallet.

26
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,495
Have I been kidnapped?

27
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,140
Okay, look. If you're holding me
for ransom,

28
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,600
my mom doesn't have any money.

29
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,669
Yeah, no shit. You don't exactly
scream "high-value target."

30
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,048
We just have some questions
about what you saw last night.

31
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,487
I didn't see anything.

32
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,364
We know that's not true.

33
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,117
Well... What I meant was, what...
What I did see, I'm...

34
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,453
I didn't understand,
and I'm more than willing to forget it.

35
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,313
No? Why were you creeping around
in the first place?

36
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,835
And you can drop that right fucking now.

37
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,736
Before I rip it from your bony hands
and shove it up your ass.

38
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:27,327
I... But I wasn't creeping.
I came for help.

39
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,497
What kind of help?

40
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,419
Did you guys hear about Sam?

41
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,462
Our Sam?

42
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,094
A girl got shot in Central Park.

43
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,140
What?

44
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,869
Sam got shot.

45
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,954
Is Sam okay?

46
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,189
Yeah, she's alive.

47
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,168
She's in a coma.

48
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,695
But I was there in the park, I found her.

49
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,781
Damn, Charlie man.

50
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,492
Did you see anything else?

51
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,263
Yeah.

52
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,290
There was this guy standing over her.

53
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,144
He seemed upset, but...

54
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,754
But maybe more like he found her
than he hurt her.

55
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,398
I don't know.

56
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,633
I heard police sirens and then I ran, but...

57
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,429
There was a...

58
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,768
a hole in her forehead.

59
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,313
There was blood everywhere.

60
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,483
I mean, if I'd been on time, you know,
if only I'd...

61
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,715
Instead I was dancing, and stealing drinks
and getting high.

62
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,784
But I just wanted a good story
to tell her, you know.

63
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,162
She loves a good story.

64
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,976
Why did you come here?

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,728
I mean, I didn't know where else to go.

66
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,046
But, I mean, you guys know Sam.

67
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,549
Right?

68
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,153
You might know why she made plans
to hang out and then just took off?

69
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,989
Why she left me at that club

70
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,432
and then went somewhere
we'd never gone before and got shot?

71
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,994
Please, you guys have to help me.

72
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,749
I-I have no one else. My...
My mom, she'll just ground me forever.

73
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,169
My therapist will just tell me
that I'm trying to save Sam

74
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,879
because I couldn't save my dad, or some...

75
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,238
What happened to your dad?

76
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,952
He...

77
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,747
He died in North Tower.

78
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,084
Oh, fuck.

79
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,762
Charlie man?

80
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,433
You came to the right place.
We're gonna figure this out.

81
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,427
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

82
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,161
It's Bruno. You love Bruno.

83
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,892
Bruno loves Bruno. He's my gallerist.

84
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,585
He only cares about one thing
and that is art he can sell.

85
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,796
And he brought Jenny.

86
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,442
Gallery girls are the fucking worst.

87
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,652
How they fawn over you
and tell you you're a genius.

88
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,761
That's terrible.

89
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,722
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

90
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,331
- This hair, though!
- Stop it.

91
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,624
Did you do that yourself,

92
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,125
- or did you bring somebody over?
- Please.

93
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,044
- Professional all the way.
- Professional.

94
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,837
You wanna know the problem with William?

95
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,589
I'll explain it to you, Mercer. Okay?

96
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,032
Please. He's very familiar with my flaws.

97
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,368
He was too naturally talented.

98
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,096
That's... How tragic.

99
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,723
- Stop.
- It's awful. Really.

100
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,225
No. It's true. Okay?

101
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,436
Everything has happened for him.
Without any effort, right?

102
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,397
Born to great wealth.
Never needed to work a day in his life.

103
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,858
So when he struggles,
he views this as a failure,

104
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,027
instead of part of the process. You see?

105
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,195
Okay, therapy.

106
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,279
You can't blame him.

107
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,157
His band made one album,
it helped define a generation.

108
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,742
Then he gives up music to paint,

109
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,245
and his first show
gets the cover of Art Forum.

110
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,747
Yes, and every collector
from Miami to Beijing

111
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,957
is fighting over his pieces.

112
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,583
Except, there's only one little problem...

113
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,460
Here we go. It's coming.

114
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,088
They wait, but then there's no more art.

115
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:33,466
It's coming, the art is coming.

116
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,219
- I just need a few more months...
- This is what you always say to me,

117
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,804
and so this is what I tell the buyers.

118
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,223
But you know what? When there's nothing,
they look at me like I'm a liar.

119
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,307
- Well, I...
- Actually,

120
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,102
I'm usually the one
on the phone dealing with the clients.

121
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,687
You must have something
you're ready to show them.

122
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:50,275
He spends all of his time in the studio.
He's there every day for hours?

123
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,527
There are some things
that I am working on, yes.

124
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,406
There are ideas. They're more like...
More of concepts, really.

125
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,142
I am very excited for them
to reach their potential.

126
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,913
But, as I've said,
I need a little more time.

127
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,541
No. Look, there is no more time, okay?

128
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,669
Please. William,
people are starting to ask me if you died.

129
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,006
What a bastard. Hey!
The more pent-up demand is, right?

130
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,800
- The higher the price is.
- Come on. He's just being modest.

131
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,596
He never thinks
anything he does is any good.

132
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,806
Okay, well, we will be the judge of that.

133
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,183
Ben.

134
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,810
- What does that mean? What are you doing?
- What? We're leaving.

135
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,437
- Where are we going?
- We're going to the studio.

136
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,482
We all must see what it is
that you have been creating.

137
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,358
I'm gonna get an espresso first, though.

138
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,861
Look, everyone is here
because we are rooting for you.

139
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,154
All right? We love you, William.

140
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,618
- Would you like anything else?
- No.

141
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,411
- Come on. Let's go.
- Go, get a cab.

142
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,288
I'll meet you outside, okay?
I'm gonna hit the head.

143
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,396
Okay.

144
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:01,954
My mom has night terrors.
Like, dreams where I die.

145
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,874
So it's hard for her to even let me
go to school, you know?

146
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,462
Which means she hated Sam.

147
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,067
'Cause Sam pulled me into the world.

148
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:20,180
Into Sam's world,
which is not exactly risk-free.

149
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,314
So what happened was basically
Ramona Weisbarger's worst nightmare,

150
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,694
except it happened to Sam.

151
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,799
No thanks to me.

152
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,950
You really think
you could have protected her?

153
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,996
- Taken down a guy with a gun?
- No. I...

154
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,666
But I would have taken a bullet
for her if I was there.

155
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,127
Guilt.

156
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,797
Explains why you've been
carrying this around.

157
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,092
Charlie, the Prophet.

158
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,970
No. I haven't even read it.

159
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,557
I'm not sure
if I'd even believe it if I did. But...

160
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,146
presumably, there's something
about forgiveness in there.

161
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,023
That's what you need right now?

162
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,401
So bad I can hardly breathe.

163
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,697
Oh, Charlie. Okay, close your eyes.

164
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:27,164
You think of Samantha.
Let the thought of her fill you up.

165
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,086
Now, open your eyes.

166
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,591
Look at me. Right at me. Don't look away.

167
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,054
The Bible says that all sinners
who truly repent,

168
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,517
shall be granted great mercy
and forgiven all offenses.

169
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,063
Doesn't matter what we've done,
or why we did it.

170
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,524
This is the law of God.

171
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,444
Now, I'm no priest.

172
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,507
Just a kid who paid attention
in Sunday school.

173
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,301
But I am the only other guy here,

174
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,662
which means the job of absolution
falls on me.

175
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:13,686
Charlie Weisbarger, I absolve you.

176
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,422
You are absolved.

177
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,512
Hey, kid, what happened to Sam
is not your fault. You hear me?

178
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,557
Say it.

179
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,388
- What happened to Sam was not my fault.
- Nah, a little more like you mean it.

180
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,375
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

181
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,442
You stand up and yell it.

182
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,588
- What happened to Sam was not my fault.
- Yell it.

183
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,507
- What happened to Sam was not my fault.
- Louder!

184
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,992
What happened to Sam was not my fault!

185
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,102
Obviously, it's living
in a theoretical space.

186
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,516
Just beginning its life journey
into a more tangible form.

187
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,703
So that's a stop sign?

188
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:17,774
I mean, it was a stop sign,
but now it is a "spot" sign.

189
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,113
Come on. Yo, just...

190
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:29,179
Imagine encountering this
in the streets of New York City.

191
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,972
Yes, because the streets is the only place

192
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,290
where anyone is going to see
this piece of shit.

193
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,544
Do you have anything else, William?

194
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,193
I mean,
nothing that is as far along as this.

195
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:48,364
Far along as a "spot" sign?
I don't understand, William.

196
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,074
After all the time
you've been spending here,

197
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,243
this is all you have to show for it?

198
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,704
Please. Mercer, please. Okay?

199
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:59,042
It is obvious he has been coming here
only to get high.

200
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,419
Not to mention
that you are high right now, huh?

201
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,571
Yeah. See? You have wasted my time.

202
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,116
But worse, you are wasting your talent.

203
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,914
Controversial, but I kind of love it.

204
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:31,932
So, you shot up in the bathroom at Odeon?

205
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,499
It's not like I could've just done it
right there at the table.

206
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,024
McNally sort of frowns at that.

207
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,711
- You said you were quitting.
- I will.

208
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:48,448
I am, okay? Babe.
I really want to. I'm going to.

209
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:54,121
What I want is to stop having this fight.

210
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,916
How are we supposed to go on like this?

211
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,424
Maybe we're not supposed to.

212
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,804
You're going down a dark road, William.

213
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,309
One that ends in a "spot" sign

214
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,228
and nothing else.

215
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,102
Regan, we weren't expecting you, dear.

216
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,420
Try the eggs. It's like eating a cloud.

217
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,214
No, I'm not staying.

218
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,027
I'm just here because I thought
it might be nice for Daddy and I

219
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,594
to walk into the office together.

220
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,305
It's gonna be a rough day for him,

221
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,667
And I thought people liked us.

222
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,277
People like scandal at anyone's expense.

223
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,380
Hi, honey.

224
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,031
Hi, Daddy. You're not dressed.

225
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,010
Amory and Felicia didn't tell you?

226
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,371
I'm not going in today. Or ever.

227
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,975
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

228
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,645
My failing. It's a condition of
his pretrial release.

229
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,315
No, I read the agreement
and it said nothing about him

230
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,858
not going into the office.

231
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,529
It was in a side memo
in case the agreement was leaked,

232
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,739
as it was, the fucking vultures.

233
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,283
We'll call it retirement.
I've already started planning the party.

234
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,493
A party.

235
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:43,498
The only thing more important
than your father's defense is his health.

236
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,375
This way, he can focus on both.

237
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,570
The lawyers can come here to work.
Everything very private, comfortable.

238
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,386
Dad, is that what you want?

239
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,203
Darling, it's what everyone wants.

240
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:03,351
You work hard to create a beautiful life,
then you finally get to enjoy it.

241
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,877
The sooner the better, I say.

242
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,648
You go, sweetie. Business as usual.

243
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,693
The board needs to see
that you can handle things. Without me.

244
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:15,470
Well, I'll call you. I love you.

245
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,639
Love you too.

246
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,287
If you won't give me her number,
please just call her, it's important.

247
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,479
- Once again my name is M...
- Mercer.

248
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,626
Sorry, Mrs. Lamplighter.
I didn't realize that you knew him.

249
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,360
Oh, really? And why is that?

250
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,593
I was just stopping by to see my father.
What are you doing here?

251
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:41,205
It was the only place I knew to find you.
It couldn't wait. It's William.

252
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,810
We're having an intervention
at our apartment tonight.

253
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,770
No. He's gonna hate that.

254
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,588
Not as much as he'll hate being dead.

255
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,383
It's that bad?

256
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,745
So I've just been tasked with finding
any of William's friends and family

257
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,103
who still care about him.

258
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,232
- Yeah.
- I hope that includes you.

259
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,152
Sam is an artist.

260
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,030
Used this place as her studio,
or maybe a storage locker,

261
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,616
but not sure how any of this matters.

262
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,660
My instinct is Sam knew her shooter.

263
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,937
This doesn't feel like a
"wrong place, wrong time" situation.

264
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,483
Samantha wasn't assaulted.
Nothing was stolen.

265
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:57,865
First shot went wide,
second one got her, but didn't kill her.

266
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,595
Fact that the shooter
didn't stick around to verify, you know,

267
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,638
very thankful for that,

268
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:07,916
but it makes me think
that this was personal, but amateur.

269
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,880
A shooter with a motive,
but not a lot of experience.

270
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,304
So, the way we find this perp is motive.

271
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,588
That means learning everything
we can about your daughter.

272
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:27,686
Got any kids?

273
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,317
Not yet. I'm working on it.

274
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,445
Then you've no goddamn clue.

275
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:42,201
Moment they're born,
you do everything you can to protect them,

276
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,537
and then something like this happens.

277
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,086
Look, Mr. Yeung.

278
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:57,049
This is the hardest thing
you're ever gonna go through.

279
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:01,011
And everybody needs something to lean on.

280
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:06,099
To believe in. For me,
I believe in a father's love.

281
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,684
I believe in you.

282
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,980
We're gonna find who did this to her,
but not without your help.

283
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,733
You know Samantha better than anyone.

284
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,404
That one's her favorite.

285
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,251
You know, I think I heard
that music is good for people in comas.

286
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,087
Keeps them connected.

287
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,426
You find a cell phone?

288
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:44,054
No. Did she have one?

289
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,558
Never gave me her number,
but I saw her on it a couple times.

290
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,769
Could be someone who didn't want us
to know who her friends were.

291
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:53,605
You'll wanna see this.

292
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,613
She calls it a zine.

293
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,492
Was always working on it.

294
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,639
Heading over to Kinko's all hours,
making copies.

295
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:13,542
If you wanna know my daughter,
it's in there.

296
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,347
So, how'd you end up down here?

297
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,809
I guess because I love roller coasters.

298
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,355
My mom died when I was 16.

299
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:39,401
No dad, so I just kind of drifted up north
from Louisiana after that.

300
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,948
Cleaned motel rooms from Memphis
to Nashville to Cincinnati.

301
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,577
Then I heard about Cedar Point
in Sandusky, Ohio.

302
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,931
Figured a place with
18 world-class roller coasters

303
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,790
and a water park couldn't be all bad.

304
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,794
But I was wrong.

305
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,150
I don't know what you've heard
about cleaning motel rooms, Charlie,

306
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:04,593
but it's a low-pay, high-risk profession.

307
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,845
Math only goes your way for so long.

308
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:08,931
And then what happens?

309
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,809
Then it goes the other way.

310
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,109
So...

311
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,380
that's why they call you Sewer Girl?

312
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,716
'Cause you were, like,
living in the gutters or...

313
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,824
No.

314
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,287
No, Nicky says I'm stuck
on a lower level of consciousness.

315
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:35,266
I still get sentimental
about cute animal pics

316
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,667
and my horoscope and shit.

317
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,354
He says I can pick a new name
once I evolve,

318
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,630
but I don't know, kinda used to it.

319
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,235
Okay, sorry, what?
So, what's the deal with Nicky?

320
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,459
I thought he was, like,
the lead singer in a cover band?

321
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,514
You don't get it, Charlie.

322
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:55,644
But you will. The band is the cover.

323
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,320
Come with me.

324
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,408
Now.

325
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,413
Come on.

326
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,030
Okay. This is the band's rehearsal space,
but we're converting it.

327
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,806
To what, you don't need to know.

328
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,243
But all this equipment
goes into the basement,

329
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,477
the window needs to be covered
and the carpet has to go.

330
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,564
That's a lot of carpet.

331
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,560
Then you better get started.

332
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,778
Wait, I'm doing this all by myself?

333
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,489
Was this Nicky's idea?

334
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,993
Nothing happens here
that isn't Nicky's idea.

335
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,313
Hey. Is that for me?

336
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,524
It's none of your goddamn business
is what it is.

337
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:12,925
He was awkward. Like a puppy.
Sweet-eyed. Smiley.

338
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,010
Maybe some freckles.

339
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:20,682
And his hair was curly.
White boy curly. A mop.

340
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,644
Like this?

341
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,371
That's him.

342
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,148
Nailed it.
That kid's a fucking labradoodle.

343
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,961
Wait. A shooting? What shooting?

344
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:36,114
The... Right outside the party.
The girl in Central Park.

345
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,659
Poor thing was an NYU student.

346
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,805
Mercer found her
and put his jacket over her.

347
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,429
Well, it's like... It was William's jacket,
'cause he borrowed it.

348
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:48,353
And then when the cops found the drugs,

349
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,255
that's when Mercer realized
that William's a fucking junkie.

350
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,068
Is she okay, this girl?

351
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,070
You know anything else about her?

352
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,096
I mean, she's in a coma.

353
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,991
And they're not releasing
any other information.

354
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,912
Apparently she's a freshman, I think.
I don't know.

355
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:06,996
She's freshman.

356
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,832
What difference does it make, really, right?

357
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,983
You're right. Yeah, it's tragic.

358
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,299
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.
I am so fucking nervous.

359
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,759
I get it.

360
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,010
Hello.

361
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,095
Regan,

362
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,122
there's an emergency board meeting.
We need to convene at the office.

363
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,268
- Tonight?
- Afraid so. It's time-sensitive.

364
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,960
I can't. Just reschedule.

365
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:33,148
Well, surely Keith can watch the children.

366
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,274
As we feared,

367
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,985
the board is extremely concerned
about the charges against Bill.

368
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,344
So then reassure them that he's innocent.

369
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,031
- Can you get...?
- Well, I...

370
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,450
- Obviously, I have, strenuously, but...
- Kids.

371
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,621
Amory, it's William.
He's in trouble, and I need to be there.

372
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,666
William.
I hadn't realized you'd connected.

373
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,459
I'm sorry to put you in this position

374
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,420
having to choose between your father
and your brother,

375
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,297
but this is where we are.

376
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:59,007
I'm here if you need me.

377
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,282
Goodbye, Amory.

378
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,208
If I wanted to share, I would. Okay.

379
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,460
My dear, your favorite.

380
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,606
- Salmon.
- Okay.

381
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,442
Oh, my God. I cannot be late.
I have to go.

382
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,402
But you're staying. Right, Mom?

383
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,432
Which we should thank her for.

384
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:31,080
I told you, Cate. Give it up.
They're not getting back together.

385
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:34,358
- Hey, we don't know that.
- Yeah, we do.

386
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,946
Still, there's nothing
more important than family.

387
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,614
Okay?

388
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,242
I love you both.

389
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,619
Will, just try it, please.

390
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,642
You got an eyeful today.
Like what you saw?

391
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:13,581
I didn't not like it.
I just don't understand.

392
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:17,776
You're Sol's girl, right?
So, are you with Nicky too, or what?

393
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:22,757
I won't apologize for not conforming
to your delicate suburban sensibilities.

394
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,909
Monogamy is just a tool of
patriarchal capitalism.

395
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,306
That sounds exactly like something
that Sam would say,

396
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,475
and that I would, like,
pretend to understand.

397
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,667
Sam is a believer.

398
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,044
A believer in what, sleeping around?

399
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,840
If you ask me, Sammy's saving herself.

400
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:42,926
For what?

401
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,764
Who knows? Could be you, Charlie man.

402
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,059
Hey. Come over here.

403
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,957
When we started this revolution,
we knew it would have a cost.

404
00:30:55,981 --> 00:31:00,986
And tonight, we celebrate
a wounded warrior fighting for her life.

405
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,655
To Sam. Tonight's for her.

406
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,092
- To Sammy.
- To Sam.

407
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,618
- To Sammy.
- Sam.

408
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,582
What's for Sam? What are we doing?

409
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,338
We don't even know this fucking kid.

410
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,984
He has had a rather rapid ascent
into our good graces,

411
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,819
but what does he bring
to the table, really?

412
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:25,904
Sam likes him.

413
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:29,806
Yeah? Well, she didn't tell him shit.
So, why should we?

414
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,185
All right, well, whatever Sam knew,
I wanna know too.

415
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,040
Knock me out. Lock me up.
Force me into hard labor.

416
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:40,943
Whatever. I'm all in.

417
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,695
Oh, shit.

418
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:46,823
He's all in.

419
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,451
Guess we'll see about that.

420
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,081
The zero hour is upon us.

421
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,001
Let's have some fun.

422
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,727
- Relax. William wouldn't knock.
- Right.

423
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,815
- Hi.
- Hey.

424
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,526
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Uh-huh.

425
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:27,155
Regan, this is Venus De Nylon.

426
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:30,385
Hi. I'm William's sister.

427
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,761
Didn't know he had a sister.

428
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,079
Venus played keyboard for Ex Post Facto.

429
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:35,849
Had to represent.

430
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:39,376
Everyone from the original band's
either more fucked up than Billy,

431
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,231
hates him or is already dead.

432
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:46,067
Well, we who are living
will have to do everything that we can.

433
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,509
Hello. Hi.

434
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,261
Come.

435
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,098
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

436
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:54,766
Hey.

437
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,061
I just wanted to say thank you

438
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:02,292
for being there for William
when no one else was.

439
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,878
Of course.

440
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:05,962
So, everyone ready?

441
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,006
- Yes.
- Yeah.

442
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,134
Any moment now,
William's gonna walk through that door,

443
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:14,328
and he is probably not gonna like
what he sees.

444
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,372
Because you're here to tell him
that you love him.

445
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,626
Love makes people accountable.

446
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,042
Hey, you've reached Sam.
Please leave a message,

447
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,235
or you can do it the old-fashioned way
and page me.

448
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:49,821
The mailbox is full
and cannot accept any messages...

449
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,745
- Hello.
- Hey, Mrs. Santos.

450
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,438
I hope I haven't called too late.

451
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,801
Hello, William. My name's Earl.

452
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,113
These good folks here gathered today

453
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,473
because they're afraid
that you're gonna die.

454
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,187
Would you like to have a seat?

455
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,943
No, Earl, I would not.

456
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:55,048
Okay, listen. This was my idea, William.

457
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:58,408
So you can be mad at me, but mostly,
you need to be mad at yourself.

458
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,680
Because your addiction
is diminishing your work as an artist,

459
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,850
but your lying,
your lying is diminishing you as a person.

460
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,752
So please, please don't act like
you are better than this.

461
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:10,587
You're done?

462
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:20,681
Earl here is just doing his job.
And I appreciate that.

463
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,686
Fuck. I mean, Bruno, I understand.

464
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:31,149
I have nothing for you to sell,

465
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:35,487
and therefore I am of no value to you.

466
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,122
But you, babe.

467
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,335
You?

468
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,298
Did you really think this was gonna work?

469
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,026
He didn't think this would work.

470
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,678
He's just running out of ways
to show you that he loves you.

471
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,825
Who are you exactly?

472
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,393
Don't... Please don't do that.

473
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:09,855
I'm impressed.

474
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,358
Hey, Reegs.

475
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:18,882
What... What has it been, 15 years, right?

476
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:20,616
Yeah. Give or take.

477
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,579
That's how long it took me to find you.

478
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,058
Really?

479
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:33,504
Don't do that. Don't go. No.

480
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,399
I miss you.

481
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:39,819
- Oh, my God.
- No, I miss you so much.

482
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:44,199
- I can't do this right now. I can't.
- I never stopped missing you.

483
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:46,058
I wasn't that hard to find.

484
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,520
- So whatever this is...
- No.

485
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,542
- I was in a band. We made an album.
- I know.

486
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:59,088
I had a show at a gallery
that was reviewed

487
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,615
by The New York fucking Times.

488
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,287
I was never more
than 20 minutes away from you.

489
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,516
You could have walked.

490
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,604
I had a family. I had two kids.
I was married. I had a job. I was...

491
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,105
I was right fucking there.

492
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:19,258
- Right where you left me. Right there.
- Where...

493
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,343
Where I left you.

494
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,603
I wanted you to come with me.

495
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:38,986
I fucking begged you to come with me.
I just wanted to protect you.

496
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,382
I wanted our father to protect you.

497
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:46,344
I didn't know what else to do.
I was hanging on by a fucking thread.

498
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,620
I had to find a way to survive. I didn't...

499
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:51,307
- Well, congratulations, Reegs...
- Please.

500
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:53,250
...that you survived. You did it.

501
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,296
Please.

502
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:02,551
You don't have to do anything.

503
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:06,072
I love you.

504
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,782
I don't even know these people,

505
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,684
but I wish you understood
how much I love you.

506
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:14,038
Do you know that Dad is sick?

507
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:14,957
Dad?

508
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:18,209
Do you know that he would
welcome you back with open fucking arms?

509
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,319
Daddy is a fucking coward.

510
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:26,533
You are a coward.

511
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:31,264
All of you, everyone here
is a fucking coward! Okay?

512
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:34,208
What, and shooting dope
is your idea of bravery?

513
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,561
You're so fucking cool, aren't you?

514
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:42,066
Sounds like there is a lot to discuss.
So let's all sit and just have some tea.

515
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,363
You see, this is why I came home.

516
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,575
I remembered it was here.
So, thank you all very much.

517
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,373
William, you can change your whole life
right now with just one decision.

518
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:01,377
Please, William,
will you just listen to him?

519
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,880
- I'm begging you. You'll thank me...
- Shut up! Please stop!

520
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,781
Stop. Mercer.

521
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,000
So, if I leave with Earl here,
it's the only way you'll love me?

522
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,711
I don't want that kind of love.

523
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,924
No, thank you. I don't want that.

524
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,445
I'm so sorry.

525
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,521
Hey, Tony. How you doing?

526
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:04,149
Listen, I'm heading to Aspen
with the family tonight.

527
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:06,401
I could drop the paperwork on the way.

528
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,720
Yeah, thank you. Is that gonna work?
I got it with me.

529
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,890
Okay. All right, great.
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

530
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:38,874
Looking for something?

531
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:41,627
I'm guessing you want this back.

532
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:45,547
I'm Sam.

533
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,388
- Hey, Sam.
- Hi.

534
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,782
This is so wrong. Let's go anywhere else.

535
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,451
- No.
- There's a W in Union Square.

536
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:41,162
This is way more fun.
There are no boys allowed after 11:00.

537
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,271
- Boys?
- Yes.

538
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:43,897
Sam.

539
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:17,139
Your roommate's panda fetish
isn't making this any less weird.

540
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,784
She's in Des Moines for the holidays,

541
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:22,704
- so you can focus on me, not her.
- Okay.

542
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:24,688
What about you? What are you into?

543
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:27,316
'Cause it looks like you
don't even live here.

544
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:31,945
I'm into you. And you know where I live.

545
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:41,598
Speaking of...

546
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:42,682
Yeah?

547
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:45,375
Now that I know you, I realized I don't...

548
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:51,507
I don't really know you.
A married finance guy.

549
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,553
How did you end up on my doorstep?

550
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,560
You're not the only one with secrets.

551
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,773
Who, me? I'm an open book.

552
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:19,034
That's the biggest lie you've told yet.
Look how easily it came.

553
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:23,080
- Tell me who you work for.
- No one. I'm self-employed.

554
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,666
Everyone answers to someone.

555
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,121
Hi.

556
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:48,145
Hey.

557
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,333
That's my door.

558
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:54,778
Right.

559
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,613
Panda lover from Des Moines.

560
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:58,967
I'm a friend of Samantha's.

561
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:03,680
I was just wondering if you knew
how she's doing,

562
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:05,431
or if you've seen her
in the last couple of days.

563
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:09,102
Yeah, the cops wondered that too.

564
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:10,210
The cops were here?

565
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:12,629
I...

566
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:16,633
Hey, can I ask you...

567
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:21,263
Sam told me she was gonna
be a senior this fall.

568
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:26,810
No.
She started last fall. She's a freshman.

569
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:04,782
Hey. I can do lunch tomorrow. Okay.

570
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:08,495
Tim, I appreciate
that you've always had my back.

571
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,897
Thank you. We'll stay in touch.
All right, thank you.

572
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:16,527
Regan,
how did the reunion go with William?

573
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:21,174
It was short-lived.
And I see I'm too late.

574
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:25,261
Not at all. Amory has swooped in
and saved the day.

575
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:30,183
He's interim chair until we can find
a suitable replacement for your father.

576
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:33,394
The board is very happy.
The ship has been steadied.

577
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,313
Yeah, or hijacked.

578
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:39,150
I mean,
you force my father into retirement

579
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:42,237
and then the CEO job
just falls right into your lap.

580
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:45,514
Interim. Until we can find
a permanent replacement.

581
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:48,642
I'm sorry things didn't go so well
with your brother.

582
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:53,522
But I need you too, now more than ever.

583
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:55,524
We need each other.

584
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,359
I'll see you in the morning.

585
00:46:58,694 --> 00:46:59,695
Yeah.

586
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:03,574
Don't.

587
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,991
Come on, Prophet. Front and center.

588
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,975
- Come here. Hey.
- What?

589
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:35,981
Ne cede malis. Means "yield not to evil."

590
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,443
It's the motto of the Bronx. Come on.

591
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,956
Fucking beautiful.

592
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,504
What's the matter, Charlie man?

593
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,550
I don't understand what we're doing here.

594
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:07,906
Sam loves music. She's not into violence.

595
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,241
- She'd never hurt anybody.
- And neither would we.

596
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:12,768
It's okay, Charlie.
No one lives in that building.

597
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:17,189
Then why?

598
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:21,527
Sam asked the same questions you are.

599
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:26,532
I tried my best to answer.
We love this city.

600
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:30,285
We think it should belong
to the musicians and the artists.

601
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,372
To the Black and the brown folks.

602
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:38,043
To the dreamers, the junkies, the poets.

603
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:42,673
But some very bad people
are trying to take that away from us, and...

604
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,176
we're just fighting back.

605
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,072
By setting it on fire?

606
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,889
Hey, you're gonna have to trust me, Prophet.

607
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,475
There's a plan.

608
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,871
A plan to keep this city for the people

609
00:48:56,895 --> 00:49:00,107
and lock up those bastards
who are stealing our island.

610
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,627
We're building a new world

611
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:05,505
that requires the destruction
of the old one.

612
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:09,259
Also, it feels really fucking good
to blow shit up.

613
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:13,328
- So fucking good.
- Hell yeah.

614
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:15,831
We sang songs about it.

615
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,047
If the question you're asking is,
"What would Sam do?"

616
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:29,094
I think we all know the answer.
Sam was one of us,

617
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:32,073
and you're not gonna get closer
to the truth of what happened to her

618
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:33,337
running in the other direction.

619
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:40,647
Come on, Charlie. Join us.
Show Sam what you're made of.

620
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:55,305
Police are looking for a Caucasian male
between 15 and 25.

621
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,474
Medium height, slim build,
dark hair and eyes.

622
00:49:58,498 --> 00:49:59,809
Anyone with information,

623
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:04,606
please call the NYPD at 212-111-TIPS.

624
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,714
As shootings in the park...

625
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,151
Skinny kid, bushy hair.

626
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,528
Like a poodle died on his head.

627
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:13,514
He wasn't a kid. He was, like, 40.

628
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:17,392
Preppy, clean-cut, Rolex.

629
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,881
I'm gonna go pull that tape.

630
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:32,025
If it's not the 28 jeans kid,
then who the hell is it?

631
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:33,992
Come with me.

632
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,179
- Yeah.
- Hey.

633
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:38,348
The kid in the photo,
his mother called in.

634
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,207
Okay, yeah. I'll head right over.

635
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:54,596
Summers in Southampton.
So many good memories.

636
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,816
Some things are better left forgotten.

637
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,423
- Come on, Charlie.
- Come on, Prophet.

638
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,051
- You can do it, Charlie. Breathe.
- Do it.

639
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:16,386
- We believe in you.
- Come on.

640
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,971
- Don't even think about it.
- Come on, Prophet.

641
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,079
Just throw it.

642
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:54,007
- We can head out.
- Let's go.

643
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,091
Yeah.

644
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,408
Come on, Charlie man.

645
00:51:57,826 --> 00:51:59,578
Come on, Charlie man! Come on!

646
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:29,983
Keith?

647
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,491
So, what was so urgent
that it couldn't wait till morning?

648
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,722
This is where the girl was shot.

649
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:45,249
Yeah, I saw the police from the party.

650
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:49,586
You have a special interest in this case?

651
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,799
I was just won... I mean...

652
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,761
I think I know who she is.

653
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:03,267
And I was wondering if you knew if...

654
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:06,812
if you...

655
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,042
If you knew about...

656
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:13,586
Keith, what is there to know
about a young girl

657
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,006
and a married man
who owes his good fortune,

658
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,052
not to mention his actual fortune,
to his lovely wife's family?

659
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:26,391
Surely such a man wouldn't mix business
with that kind of pleasure.

660
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,351
No. That wouldn't be smart.

661
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:32,504
It would be pure stupidity.
It would be dangerous even.

662
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:35,424
Jesus, Amory.

663
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,141
What happened here, is it because of you?

664
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,311
Come on, Keith.

665
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:50,731
We both know that what happened here...

666
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,235
is because of you.
