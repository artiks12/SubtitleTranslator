1
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,497
Should've known you'd be early.

2
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,293
You look tired already.

3
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,255
I was hoping to meet Juliette Nichols
before you keel over.

4
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,871
We'll see who gets tuckered out.

5
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
- After you.
- Thank you.

6
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,034
You dead?

7
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,329
Bet you wish you were.

8
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,082
Come on, you're late.

9
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,712
How did you get in here?

10
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,299
You threw up in the hallway.

11
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,802
And by the smell of it,
pretty much everywhere.

12
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,556
- Could you talk about something else?
- Oh, you mean something other than vomit?

13
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,891
You don't want me talking about puking?

14
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,322
Why you wearing that again?

15
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,363
You gonna tell me what's going on?

16
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,699
You're not a drinker, Jules.

17
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,076
Not a good one, no.

18
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,169
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

19
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,343
Shit. My fix is failing.

20
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,827
- Water?
- Sure.

21
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,538
Here.

22
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,504
Unless you dumped water to lighten
your load, I think you got a leak.

23
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,674
You wanna say hello to the judge?

24
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,679
But you do want her goons to be sure
and see you standing here.

25
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,443
Hey!

26
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,908
- No, I... I was just gonna do s...
- No!

27
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,744
- Juliette, how am I supposed to learn...
- No! Enough!

28
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,567
You wanna tell me what's going on?

29
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,863
'Cause I'm at a damn loss.

30
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,114
You told Cooper to go in.

31
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,033
Was I supposed to wait for you to show up?

32
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,495
- Really incredible smell, by the way.
- You know my rules.

33
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,581
Your rules?

34
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,958
Last I heard, I'm the head of Mechanical,
and you're my shadow.

35
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,544
Though I can't remember the last time
you actually listened to me.

36
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:45,256
- Only I go through the hatch.
- So you feel okay about decking Coop?

37
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,217
Jules, he's your shadow.
The kid fucking worships you.

38
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,720
It's my job to make sure it's running.

39
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,014
And you care so much
that you showed up two hours late.

40
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,932
We're putting off the inevitable.

41
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,935
We have to shut it down
and make a real fix.

42
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,898
Jules, I can't be the first guy
in the history of the Silo

43
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,317
- to shut the generator down.
- Better it happen on our terms

44
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,444
with the backup running
than the rotor shattering...

45
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,446
Even an hour in darkness
will be utter chaos.

46
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,406
- Nothing compared to what's gonna happen...
- Jules.

47
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,575
It's fucking better it happens
on our terms

48
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,244
- than the rotor shattering!
- Jules, I'll tell... I'll tell you what.

49
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,024
I'll tell you what.

50
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:26,089
We'll have this discussion tomorrow
when you're not hungover or still drunk.

51
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,885
Go home.

52
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,056
Wash off whatever it is I'm smelling
and take your punishment.

53
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,434
You punched Cooper in the face.

54
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,978
You either gotta do a day
on the trash line

55
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,940
or work off some tickets with Walker.

56
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,277
Can't I just let him punch me back?

57
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,866
I was gonna come out
to applaud. Walking the Silo at...

58
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,661
If you say "at your age,"
you don't get what I brought you.

59
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,829
What did you bring me?

60
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,625
Just a little token of my gratitude
for all we've done together.

61
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,126
Well, gee,
I'm glad somebody's getting something.

62
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,754
I joined her on this march of death,

63
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,715
and she hasn't given me anything
but grief.

64
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,592
You must really want something.

65
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,555
Well, I might need a little help
with our friend in the robe.

66
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,055
Judge Meadows.

67
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,564
Her office messaged me
and said you neglected to stop by.

68
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,867
Do you want Paul Billings to be sheriff?

69
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,452
Mayor, you know me.
Doesn't matter what I want.

70
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,121
You just run the numbers.

71
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,833
Which tell me that Paul Billings
is the most favorable candidate.

72
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,044
Is that for the Silo, or is that for IT?

73
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,589
What did your numbers say about Holston?

74
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,051
They said he'd be a great sheriff,
which he was until he wasn't.

75
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,017
What do they say about Juliette Nichols?

76
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,648
- I don't need her numbers. She's a thief.
- Thief?

77
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,733
Her record's clean.

78
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,945
She stole four boxes of H57 tape
reserved for IT.

79
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,739
- She stole tape.
- Not just any tape.

80
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,451
Heat tape we use to prevent our servers
from cooking.

81
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:22,164
And honestly,
the problem isn't what she stole.

82
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,835
- It's the fact that she stole at all.
- Bernard, she was Holston's pick.

83
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,214
Mayor, you can't seriously consider her.

84
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,424
Deputy.

85
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,676
- Doesn't matter what he thinks.
- I'm just the escort.

86
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,347
I don't like Judicial's choice
being shoved down my throat.

87
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,974
Mayor, bringing me a bottle of brandy

88
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,645
is not going to help you
win a turf battle with Judge Meadows.

89
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,021
It's good brandy.

90
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,316
It could be from the before times
for all I care.

91
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,611
Here are some other numbers
you should consider.

92
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,863
Every hour the Silo is without a sheriff,

93
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,492
the probability of catastrophe
increases by one point.

94
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,079
While we're sitting here chitchatting,
frightened citizens are arming themselves,

95
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,624
because they don't know
who's going to protect them.

96
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,085
Billings is a good choice.

97
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,044
Just make him sheriff,

98
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:14,800
and leave walking the Silo to kids
with nothing better to do.

99
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:31,775
She's coming.

100
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:34,987
She's coming.

101
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,829
- Couldn't help yourself, could you?
- So I sent word.

102
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,664
They need us now, Sam.

103
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,792
Mayor! Welcome to the Mids.

104
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,046
- Welcome to the Mids, Mayor Jahns!
- Hi. Hello!

105
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,383
I know it's been a long time
since I crossed this bridge.

106
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,022
We're all scared.

107
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,610
We lost a great man and a fine sheriff,
but it's this community.

108
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:19,573
It's the way you love each other
that truly holds the Silo together

109
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,743
even when times are tough, like now.

110
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,994
We love you, Mayor Jahns.

111
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,122
I'm voting for you in the next election.
We're all voting for you.

112
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,207
Yes.

113
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,380
but I'm not gonna leave this level
till I see the babies.

114
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,261
- This is Jacob, Mayor Jahns. - Oh. Lovely. Very good to see you.

115
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,355
This is Harry.

116
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,482
Harry was in a hurry.
Came out three weeks early.

117
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,904
As I recall from your last visit,

118
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,281
you like to say hello
to any mothers-to-be.

119
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,453
Actually, Doctor, we were hoping
for a moment with you alone.

120
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,708
We were hoping to talk to you
about your daughter, Juliette.

121
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,338
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

122
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,633
She's being considered for a new position.

123
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,593
- Mmm.
- Just the standard vetting.

124
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,513
- Any questions I can answer?
- How come she lives down deep?

125
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:29,475
You understand it is unusual
for someone born in the Mids

126
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,689
with a doctor for a father
to end up in Mechanical.

127
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,361
Our troubles started.

128
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,658
It was hard on Jules.

129
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,411
A loss like that...

130
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,542
She showed real interest in machines
from an early age.

131
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,920
Always figuring out how things worked,
how to fix them if they didn't.

132
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,467
I think it felt good
to be able to fix something.

133
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,099
- How old was she when she left?
- Thirteen.

134
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,685
When did you last speak to her?

135
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,439
It's been a while.

136
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,484
I have new babies every week.

137
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,945
Jules has the generator.
It's a long walk down to Mechanical.

138
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:27,576
I can't get there and back on my day off.
I need that day to rest.

139
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,205
Well. If that's all,
I have an expectant mother in breech,

140
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,583
and I need to get baby turned around.

141
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,762
More questions than answers.

142
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,600
It's so hard to describe.

143
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,519
What you saw or what you felt?

144
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,855
- No, I felt fine.
- Okay.

145
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,234
It wasn't the darkness
I was worried about. I, uh...

146
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,779
No, I didn't feel scared.

147
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,199
- If I was scared, I'd tell you.
- Okay.

148
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,495
Okay, fuck. Yeah, I felt scared. I, uh...

149
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,583
That much water, it's...

150
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,128
It was just more water
than I've ever seen.

151
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,556
You know, George, he...

152
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,728
He left me all these clues,
and I couldn't do it.

153
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,147
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't go down there.

154
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,819
- That's what I feel. I feel pissed off.
- So pissed off you took it out on Cooper.

155
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,029
- I don't wanna talk about Cooper.
- What do you want?

156
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,911
Run away.

157
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:57,040
It's okay. I get that. I get it.

158
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,377
You know, we scream, we fight, we get mad.

159
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,589
But every now and then,
we should tell ourselves,

160
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,925
- "We did what we could. We did our best."
- "We." Really? "We"?

161
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,928
I don't even know why I'm getting advice
from someone who sits at her bench

162
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,097
every day listening to the radio.

163
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,893
You haven't left the workshop in 20 years.

164
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,244
Did I ever tell you
about the first arrest I made?

165
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,205
It was right here in this park,
right over there.

166
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:41,709
3:00 a.m. Drunk, naked couple going at it.
That was my first arrest.

167
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,419
You know what my second arrest was?

168
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,381
Twenty-four hours later. Same drunken
couple going at it right there.

169
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,556
It's time.

170
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:59,227
I was thinking that maybe I might open up
a stall in the market,

171
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:04,691
try to sell my drawings to anybody
blind enough to want 'em.

172
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,069
I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do.

173
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,655
I always thought Holston
would take over from me.

174
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:16,368
Compliments of Judge Meadows.
Strawberries fresh from the farm.

175
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,081
If you haven't tried this, don't.
One bite can be habit-forming.

176
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,874
Is this supposed to intimidate me?

177
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,792
Dessert?

178
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,502
No. I wanted to make sure you...

179
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,422
Anything swimming in
that much sugar is bad for the heart.

180
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,845
Then I blew it. It was supposed to be
a friendly gesture and a little nudge.

181
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:37,473
- You didn't stop by to see Judge Meadows.
- I didn't know I was supposed to.

182
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,100
Mayor, the second Holston went out,

183
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,103
the clock started
on finding his replacement.

184
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,945
Paul Billings is a good choice.

185
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,031
He's a family man,
dedicated, hardworking, smart.

186
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,491
- He cares about the people.
- Mr. Sims.

187
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,078
I'll make my decision
when I've completed my trip.

188
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,586
- Sam, you want it?
- No, Rob, I'm good.

189
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,324
Suicide is a serious crime.

190
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:37,867
No, it wasn't suicide.

191
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,369
So you've said.

192
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,137
"What I was looking for."

193
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,953
Fuck. Fuck!

194
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:32,505
- That's not good.
- No shit. Where's Jules?

195
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,275
Knox.

196
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,069
Madam Mayor. Deputy.

197
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,862
We weren't expecting you...

198
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,280
Everything all right?

199
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:00,116
- Yeah. It's all under control.
- Do you want us to come back or...

200
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,157
It's not supposed to sound
like that, is it?

201
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,354
No, ma'am.

202
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,387
- What's going on?
- The fix is failing again.

203
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,139
Yeah, I can see that.

204
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,229
- I've tried switching...
- I need to listen.

205
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,282
Is that her?

206
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,367
Yeah.

207
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,334
Excuse me, Madam Mayor.

208
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,895
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

209
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,470
Jules!

210
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,013
- The vibration's changed.
- What?

211
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,474
It's shifted. All this time,

212
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,184
- the vibration's been moving it...
- This way.

213
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,686
- And now it's going that way.
- Shit.

214
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,523
- So, what do we do?
- You leave. Check the output.

215
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,274
Hey, everybody, back.

216
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,443
- Back. Come on.
- Jules, I c... I can help.

217
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,403
I know this generator
just as much as any...

218
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,364
Coop! You're her shadow.

219
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,700
We can't have you both up here
if this goes sideways.

220
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,497
Close it behind me.
This is what I was warning you about.

221
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,624
I know.

222
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,961
Good luck.

223
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,137
Fuck.

224
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,079
Don't let her leave.

225
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,707
- Hey, Madam Mayor?
- I'll be fine.

226
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,388
If I'd known
I was getting a visit from the mayor,

227
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:28,598
I'd have tidied up.

228
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,309
You don't tidy up for old friends.

229
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,603
Besides, you knew I was coming.

230
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,522
You heard it on the radio you made.

231
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,233
Which is so prohibited by the Pact,
I don't know where to start.

232
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:44,489
You up-toppers really don't know
your machines, do you? That's a toaster.

233
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,079
I was sad your marriage broke up.

234
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,081
Was 25 years ago.

235
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,250
I was still sad.

236
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,252
You and Carla were a good couple.
What happened?

237
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,676
What can I do for you, Ruth?

238
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,929
Juliette Nichols.

239
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,140
- What about her?
- I need your honest opinion of her.

240
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,310
Who is she, Martha?

241
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,615
Am I under arrest or something?

242
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,576
Should you be?

243
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,625
- Juliette.
- Uh-huh.

244
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,210
I'm Mayor Jahns.

245
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,465
Could we have a moment?

246
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,032
Sure.

247
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:47,678
Can't you just stay?

248
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:49,554
You got this.

249
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,273
One of my duties as mayor
is appointing the next sheriff.

250
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:04,944
One of the Silo traditions is that
the outgoing sheriff leaves a suggestion

251
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:10,158
as to who should be next to wear the star.
Holston Becker chose you.

252
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,704
- I'm sorry, what?
- I must tell you,

253
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:18,082
- no one wants you for this job.
- Okay.

254
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:23,130
Except for one deceased former sheriff
and me.

255
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:28,552
I know it's a lot to take in.

256
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,144
- Pardon?
- I... I don't want it.

257
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,605
Hallelujah.

258
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,190
May I ask why?

259
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:47,654
Everyone thinks their job in the Silo
is the most important. Mine actually is.

260
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,574
The generator, she's not well.

261
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,620
And if I'm not here
to make sure she's running and...

262
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,249
I have to take care of her.

263
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,710
Well, that is too bad.

264
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:05,881
Holston wanted you to have this...

265
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,594
whether or not you took the job.

266
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,192
Take care, Juliette.

267
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:46,839
What the fuck?

268
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,845
Stop cheating.

269
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:54,930
Come on.

270
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,733
- Wow.
- That makes no sense.

271
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,319
You? Sheriff?

272
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,405
Yeah.

273
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,823
- Why?
- I don't know.

274
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,533
Because you get shit done.

275
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,995
- You'd be a great sheriff.
- Coop, you don't have to suck up.

276
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:21,122
- She's not gonna hit you again.
- It should be you, Hank.

277
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,420
- Can I see it?
- Yeah, sure.

278
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:34,886
You know, Sheriff Holston was the reason
I wanted to become a deputy.

279
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,222
I mean what do I...
What do I know about law enforcement? I...

280
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,142
What did you know about being an engineer?

281
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,896
- Not a whole lot.
- Hey. What's this?

282
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,900
Something's carved
in the back of the badge.

283
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,788
Mayor Jahns!

284
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,583
I changed my mind.

285
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,628
I'll... I'll take the job.

286
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,713
- Well, that's wonderful.
- On one condition.

287
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,798
There's a condition?

288
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,758
I need to fix the generator.

289
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,265
- Okay.
- And in order to fix the generator...

290
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,061
...I need to shut it down.

291
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,524
You need to shut down the generator?
Put us all in the dark?

292
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,360
- We've got a backup.
- Which provides minimal power.

293
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,611
Barely enough for life support.

294
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:36,030
What you're asking for,
that has never been done.

295
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,241
No. I...

296
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,034
- I know.
- People would be terrified.

297
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:44,205
People are gonna be terrified when...
When the rotor shatters,

298
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,251
and we're living off the backup
in darkness.

299
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:49,545
Forever.

300
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:55,926
I can do it.

301
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,681
In order to repair
the generator,

302
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:05,393
an eight-hour power outage
will begin tonight at 10:00 p.m.

303
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:08,855
The Silo will be completely dark
for that period.

304
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,607
You are ordered to gather
in the designated safe zones

305
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:16,363
or to stay at home.
Those failing to comply will be jailed.

306
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,923
That's how the rotor
should be spinning, right?

307
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:34,464
So sometime in the last 30 years,
something damaged it.

308
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,591
- What?
- I don't know.

309
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,968
Maybe someone dropped
a tool from the catwalk.

310
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:43,348
- How much damage?
- All it takes is one tiny dent.

311
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,649
Doesn't matter how many times
we tweak the alignment.

312
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,861
- It always moves out of place.
- So soon the entire thing is gonna break,

313
00:28:56,862 --> 00:29:00,615
which means we can't make enough juice
to power up a single level,

314
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,159
let alone the entire Silo.

315
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,496
So how do we fix it?

316
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,125
First, we're gonna open it up
and see where it's broken.

317
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:15,671
Then, to fix whatever's wrong, we're
gonna have to shut down the generator.

318
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,424
And did you tell the mayor
we can't actually do that?

319
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,884
Sure, we can.

320
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,886
Knox controls the steam flow
from down here.

321
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,554
And if he turns it off,

322
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,723
how much time do you think
we'll have before it blows up?

323
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,190
- I don't know. An hour?
- If you get half that, you'll be lucky.

324
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:35,567
Lemme show you why.

325
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,489
We don't know
what we're dealing with here,

326
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,783
so we've all gotta be ready.
Expect the worst.

327
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:46,035
Any issues, radio me here,

328
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,703
and I'll coordinate
with the other stations.

329
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,749
Be alert. We don't know what to expect.

330
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:54,253
Everyone be safe out there.

331
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,922
Molly, you and your team
head out on patrol.

332
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:01,385
- Let everyone know you're there.
- You know what to do. Let's get to it.

333
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,555
Hey, if it stays quiet,
there's a cot in holding,

334
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:08,099
and the sofa in my office pulls out.

335
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,351
- Wouldn't say either are comfortable.
- Good to know.

336
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,813
Now, could you escort the mayor
to the hostel, please?

337
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,814
- I'll stay here.
- No.

338
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:18,277
It'll be quiet, but I wanna know
how things are going in the Silo.

339
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,999
As far as we know,
the Silo's never been on backup power

340
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,210
- and you think it'll be quiet?
- Tonight they'll just be afraid.

341
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,797
And tomorrow,
if the lights don't come back on?

342
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:41,508
Hope you have the combination
to the gun safe.

343
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:49,057
The steam comes in from way down deep.
No one knows from where.

344
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,268
All we know is that it comes up
through this pipe,

345
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,562
makes this bend,
and goes straight up to the turbine.

346
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:56,064
Now, the founders were smart.

347
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,277
They knew they couldn't control how the
steam behaved, so they built in a safety.

348
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,445
This is the containment chamber.

349
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:05,823
It protects the turbine in case
there's a sudden surge

350
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,618
and someone needs to regulate the flow.

351
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:14,124
You wanna stop the generator? Knox has
to close this main valve all the way.

352
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,043
That happens, you get about 30 minutes

353
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,588
before the pressure redlines,
and he needs to release it.

354
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,299
We're gonna need more time.

355
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,550
Can we keep it in the red?

356
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,763
We could if steam was cold,
but it's not because it's steam.

357
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,223
The more pressure it's under,
the hotter it gets.

358
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:34,143
And that pressure just keeps on building
until... ...it blows.

359
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,437
So, 30 minutes before redline?

360
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,023
At most.

361
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:40,425
Boss?

362
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:46,072
The mayor's authorized
eight hours on backup.

363
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,250
- They must weigh...
- 1.35 tons. Each.

364
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:03,257
Guys, there's no part of this that's easy.

365
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:09,470
The slightest mistake at any point
could get somebody killed,

366
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:12,891
or worse,
leave 10,000 people in the dark forever.

367
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,562
Put five of our strongest guys
on each panel.

368
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:21,691
Once they're open,
I'll slow the generator down to 50%,

369
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,111
but I won't stop it. Not yet.

370
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,738
We'll identify the problem.

371
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,699
Then Jules will signal to me
when she's ready.

372
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:39,626
Our 30 minutes starts right then.
All right?

373
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,336
Yep.

374
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:44,339
Now, Jules,
who do you want up there with you?

375
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:53,015
All right. Let's get to it! Come on!

376
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,372
That's right. Stay off the stairs.

377
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,127
Stay off the s... Back inside, please, sir.
Ma'am, ma'am... Thank you.

378
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:32,679
Go ahead.

379
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:35,891
Switching to backup.

380
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,112
Backup's holding steady.

381
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,159
Cutting steam to 50%.

382
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Go ahead and start on the panels.

383
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,049
It's incredible.

384
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:36,428
Okay.

385
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:38,472
That's where I gotta go.

386
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:59,368
Hey! You okay?

387
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,621
When we get up there,
we're gonna tuck ourselves in.

388
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,872
We're gonna fix what we can.

389
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,876
Anything larger, we're gonna send
down for them to fix. Okay?

390
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,461
- Okay.
- Yeah?

391
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,547
Okay.

392
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,676
- Jules!
- Yep?

393
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:17,386
You give me the word.

394
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:31,275
All right.

395
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:33,926
Go ahead.

396
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:37,990
Closing hatch. Our 30 minutes start now.

397
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,463
Stop! We're here.

398
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,090
Okay!

399
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:42,054
Shit. Oh, it's bad.

400
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,894
Okay. This blade is the problem.
We're gonna send it down.

401
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:52,772
We'll fix the rest up here.
Get the equipment up.

402
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,900
Teddy, bring it up!

403
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,534
Coop, I need you on the other side!

404
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,004
Coop, I need you to check on that.

405
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:17,965
Okay, guys. It's going up now!

406
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,165
Come on.

407
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:38,318
You know how I say doing things right
is better than doing them fast?

408
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:39,819
Right now, I need both.

409
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,196
Where the fuck is my tool?

410
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,812
- Okay, ready? Pull.
- Uh-huh.

411
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,211
Pull.

412
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,797
Yep. Got it.

413
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:03,260
Send it down.
I need to fix the smaller blades.

414
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:17,357
We're ready!

415
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:23,112
- Hey! You got it?
- Uh-huh.

416
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:26,533
Look out!

417
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:29,938
- Look out! Heads up!
- Oh, my God. No!

418
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:33,998
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

419
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,210
Then pick the damn thing up and get it
straight so Jules can get it back in.

420
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:41,631
Hey, Cooper! Cooper, focus!
I need you on the bolts. Come on. Now!

421
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:45,511
Go! Let's do it! Come on, boys.

422
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,680
Okay, Cooper!

423
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,271
Temperature holding.

424
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,614
Daddy!

425
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,784
Daddy!

426
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,161
Daddy!

427
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:14,957
It's okay, Son.

428
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,543
It's too dark.

429
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:19,711
It's okay.

430
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:22,171
Don't worry.

431
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,466
The dark's nothing to be afraid of, okay?

432
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,095
Daddy's gonna stay here with you
till you fall asleep.

433
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,813
This is LaFontaine on 80.

434
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:40,566
All quiet up to the farms.

435
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,317
Copy that.

436
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,538
I can't sleep.

437
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,501
Then don't.

438
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:16,894
Ten thousand people
aren't sleeping right now,

439
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,272
terrified the power won't come back.

440
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:26,320
Afraid maybe the groundwater will rise,
and they'll drown.

441
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,909
Or maybe a bunch of nutjobs will bust out
through the top and let the poison in.

442
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,997
We've always been
one catastrophic failure away

443
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,291
from the end of it all,

444
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,503
and this just makes everyone
conscious of it.

445
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:45,380
Maybe that's not a bad thing.

446
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:48,967
Makes you appreciate the day you have.

447
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,513
I know you think
appointing Nichols is a mistake,

448
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:57,559
but something about her makes me hopeful.

449
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,356
Hopeful enough, I might be able
to hand the reins over to someone else.

450
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,107
You'd consider retiring?

451
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,486
To do what? Sit around and knit?

452
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:09,571
Why not?

453
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,242
Maybe open a shop

454
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,162
right next to some guy who does drawings.

455
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,796
You know I didn't come all this way
just to meet Nichols.

456
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:29,257
I wanted to spend time with you.

457
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,559
I know it's why I came.

458
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:06,086
Fuck! Boss! Boss!

459
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:08,462
It's overheating
way faster than we thought.

460
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:09,882
How much time?

461
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,176
A few minutes, maybe?

462
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,266
Jules, you gotta get out!

463
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,853
We only got a few minutes! Jules!

464
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,188
What? What did he say?

465
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:27,398
- We only have a few minutes.
- What? No.

466
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,983
No, Knox. We need more time!

467
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,610
- We're redlining!
- Already?

468
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,487
The temperature's higher than we expected!
I gotta open the valve!

469
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:37,075
No! Not without the rotor blade! Fuck.

470
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,704
Teddy! Teddy!

471
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,749
- We're trying!
- Try harder!

472
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,129
- How's it looking?
- It's getting worse.

473
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:50,589
Fuck.

474
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:52,882
Fuck.

475
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,307
Okay. Take over.

476
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:02,767
Keep working, okay?

477
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,685
- It's just like I taught you, okay?
- All right.

478
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,605
When the blade comes up,
you get it in there, you bolt it in place.

479
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,774
Make sure to get the angle right
or we're screwed.

480
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:12,693
- But I can't do this with... - No, no, no. Look at me.

481
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:15,113
You're ready. You can do it, okay?

482
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:26,065
Teddy!

483
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,793
- Another minute!
- He needs it now!

484
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:30,461
- Get it up there!
- I'm trying!

485
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:33,715
- Jules, where are you going?
- Gonna try and buy us more time!

486
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,305
Shit!

487
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,579
I got it in here. You go make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

488
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:04,537
Jules? What are you doing?

489
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,164
It's the only way to cool it down.

490
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,000
When I yell, turn it on.

491
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,126
You're going in there?

492
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,061
Now! Turn it on!

493
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,666
We're cooling down.
Fuck yes, Jules! It's working.

494
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:54,713
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. You crazy bitch.

495
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,911
Uh, stay inside, please, sir.

496
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:28,997
Thank you.

497
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,803
Help! Somebody, help!

498
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,265
Help! Help!

499
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,434
Somebody, help! Help!

500
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:53,062
I was trying to get home,
and the lights went out.

501
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:57,358
It's okay, sir. We got you now. Here.
Beson'll get you back safe.

502
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,257
Teddy, the blade!

503
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:22,384
Another minute!

504
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,306
Shit, shit.

505
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:30,099
Come on. Come on, Jules.

506
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,767
Just give me a few more minutes. Come on.

507
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,109
Come on!

508
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:45,239
Boss! Knox!

509
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,033
Teddy, hurry the fuck up!

510
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,660
Nearly there!

511
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,128
Coming in.

512
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:03,966
Faster! We're redlining again!

513
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,052
Get it up!

514
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:18,982
Jules!
The blade's goin' up to Coop!

515
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:35,832
Stop, stop! I got it!

516
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:54,685
Hurry!

517
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,420
Knox!

518
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,070
Fuck.

519
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,033
Cooper!
Get that blade on! It's gonna blow!

520
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:17,499
Come on, Coop!
You gotta get it up there!

521
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:24,381
Shirley! Come on!

522
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,427
Fuck! She's still in there!

523
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,805
We need to get her out! Fuck!

524
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:44,526
Come on!

525
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:52,451
Come on!

526
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:58,373
Come on! Help!

527
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,567
Come on, Jules.
Just give me a few more seconds.

528
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,684
Cooper! Get the fuck out now!

529
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:20,311
I'm almost there!

530
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:29,821
Come on.

531
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,202
Done!

532
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:38,914
Get him down! Get Jules out now!

533
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:47,548
- Come on!
- Fuck.

534
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,091
Go! Get her out!

535
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:51,969
Grab it! Pull!

536
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:58,517
- Jules?
- Come on!

537
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:03,605
Come on!

538
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,236
Fuck.

539
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,505
She's out! Chamber is clear!

540
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,210
- Did they get it done?
- Yeah, maybe... I think so.

541
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:25,854
Come on.

542
00:53:56,028 --> 00:54:00,198
Hope you're not expecting me
to praise you for doing your job.

543
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,117
I came to say I'm sorry for what I said.

544
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:08,289
You weren't wrong.
I haven't left this place in a long time.

545
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,418
Yeah, but I failed,
and I... I took it out on you.

546
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:13,503
How did you fail?

547
00:54:13,504 --> 00:54:16,173
I tried to do what George wanted me to,
and I... I couldn't.

548
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,969
You know, when I first
heard about you and the computer guy,

549
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,473
I... I didn't know what to think.

550
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,601
And then Shirley told me
he made you smile.

551
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:34,233
Yeah.

552
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,402
I'm sorry you didn't get to meet him.

553
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:43,199
No, it's all right. I told him not to.

554
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,536
I sent for him. I said I had a problem
with my computer,

555
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:48,455
which I didn't 'cause I built it.

556
00:54:49,498 --> 00:54:53,126
When he got here, I told him if he did
anything to hurt you,

557
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,587
he would vanish without a trace.

558
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:12,061
To take up a job you're
clearly unqualified to do.

559
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,148
Wow. I've always enjoyed
your words of encouragement.

560
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:22,072
What is that?

561
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:24,491
I don't know.
I found it with George's stuff.

562
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,326
You brought a relic into my workshop?

563
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:29,371
You love finding out how things work.

564
00:55:29,872 --> 00:55:31,247
I also like not dying.

565
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:32,748
They wouldn't send you out to clean.

566
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:35,294
The only way you'll get out of this place
is feet first.

567
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:37,880
Thanks.

568
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:42,063
Anyway, if you get a minute,
can you try and figure out what it is?

569
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:43,677
Sure.

570
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:47,264
Thanks.

571
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,237
Okay.

572
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:12,703
- for everything.
- Mm-hmm.

573
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,629
I'll send messages.

574
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,839
Sheriff gets a radio. I'll be listening.

575
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,217
Yeah, of course you will.

576
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:25,552
One more thing.

577
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,099
Don't end up like George.

578
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:04,341
Mayor Jahns,

579
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:08,637
please tell me why this Silo
spent last night in the dark.

580
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:11,973
- Because it was night.
- That's helpful, Deputy. Thank you.

581
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:15,810
It was crucial we fix the generator.
I made the call.

582
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:19,147
You made a deal with Juliette Nichols,
our soon-to-be sheriff?

583
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,649
How did you hear that, Bernard?

584
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,194
She's a thief from Mechanical.

585
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,612
She'll be great.

586
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:28,489
Ten thousand lives, Ruth.

587
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,160
And all the generations that follow that.

588
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,621
I pray to the Founders you're right.

589
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,973
It's strange. I haven't left Mechanical
since I got here.

590
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,227
It is time. There's some stuff
you gotta face up there.

591
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:03,566
And when you get sick of the up-toppers,
get your ass back down here.

592
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:06,361
We'll be waiting for a visit
from our sheriff.

593
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,364
Come on.

594
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:13,619
You're gonna be great.

595
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,330
Yeah. Okay.

596
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:19,232
Go.

597
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:35,265
What about finding out the truth?

598
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:39,810
When I find something, I will, uh...
I'll send word.

599
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:40,729
A signal.

600
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,023
I promise.

601
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,020
I hope you're not making
a horrible mistake.

602
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:29,528
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- Mmm. I'm fine.

603
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:31,280
You sure?

604
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:42,874
Why don't you grab a bottle of wine
and take me back to my apartment?

605
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:43,958
Yes, ma'am.

606
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:01,351
- Which one?
- Whatever you want.

607
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:11,069
Hey, Ruth, you think one bottle's enough?

608
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,824
Maybe I get two, huh?

609
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,202
We...

610
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:19,828
Ruth.

611
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:21,580
Ruth?

612
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:26,168
Ruth!

613
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:33,133
Ruth.

614
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:34,635
Ruth.

615
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:36,553
Ruth. Ruth!

616
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:47,773
Ruth!

617
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:50,359
Ruth.

618
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:56,322
Ruth. Oh, no.

619
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:57,573
Help!

620
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:59,075
Somebody, please!

621
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,370
Somebo... Somebody! Somebody!
