1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Sam was here all the time.
No one loves the music like her.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
For Sam, it's a religion.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Doesn't matter how crowded it is,
she always finds her way to the front.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
She never missed a show.
Every night was better than the last.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The night of the 4th,
a band was playing here, called Ex Nihilo.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You see Samantha?

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, but she didn't stay
for the show, which was unlike her.

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Must've had somewhere
real important to be.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Said she was going uptown,
but she'd be back.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But I didn't see her again. Is she okay?

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Was Samantha alone when she came by?

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With a young dude.

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He went inside. Not sure when he left.

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Size 28 jeans?
Type of guy who might piss himself?

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sounds about right.

16
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You think you can describe him
to a sketch artist?

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Bet you make it a habit to remember faces.

18
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But not talk to cops.

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Come by the station. No one has to know.

20
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, Charlie. You're awake.

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You mean conscious?

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
After being knocked unconscious
by your boyfriend?

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, Sol didn't hit you that hard.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Trust me. Think you were mostly tired.

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm also missing my
cell phone and my wallet.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Have I been kidnapped?

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, look. If you're holding me
for ransom,

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
my mom doesn't have any money.

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, no shit. You don't exactly
scream "high-value target."

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We just have some questions
about what you saw last night.

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I didn't see anything.

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We know that's not true.

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well... What I meant was, what...
What I did see, I'm...

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I didn't understand,
and I'm more than willing to forget it.

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No? Why were you creeping around
in the first place?

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And you can drop that right fucking now.

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Before I rip it from your bony hands
and shove it up your ass.

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I... But I wasn't creeping.
I came for help.

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What kind of help?

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did you guys hear about Sam?

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Our Sam?

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A girl got shot in Central Park.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sam got shot.

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is Sam okay?

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, she's alive.

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
She's in a coma.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But I was there in the park, I found her.

49
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Damn, Charlie man.

50
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Did you see anything else?

51
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah.

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There was this guy standing over her.

53
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He seemed upset, but...

54
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But maybe more like he found her
than he hurt her.

55
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't know.

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I heard police sirens and then I ran, but...

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There was a...

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
a hole in her forehead.

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There was blood everywhere.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I mean, if I'd been on time, you know,
if only I'd...

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Instead I was dancing, and stealing drinks
and getting high.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But I just wanted a good story
to tell her, you know.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She loves a good story.

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why did you come here?

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I mean, I didn't know where else to go.

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But, I mean, you guys know Sam.

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Right?

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You might know why she made plans
to hang out and then just took off?

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why she left me at that club

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and then went somewhere
we'd never gone before and got shot?

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Please, you guys have to help me.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I-I have no one else. My...
My mom, she'll just ground me forever.

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My therapist will just tell me
that I'm trying to save Sam

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
because I couldn't save my dad, or some...

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What happened to your dad?

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He...

77
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He died in North Tower.

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, fuck.

79
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Charlie man?

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You came to the right place.
We're gonna figure this out.

81
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's Bruno. You love Bruno.

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Bruno loves Bruno. He's my gallerist.

84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He only cares about one thing
and that is art he can sell.

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And he brought Jenny.

86
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Gallery girls are the fucking worst.

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How they fawn over you
and tell you you're a genius.

88
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's terrible.

89
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hi. How are you?

90
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hi.

91
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This hair, though!

92
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Stop it.

93
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you do that yourself,

94
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
or did you bring somebody over?

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please.

96
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Professional all the way.

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Professional.

98
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You wanna know the problem with William?

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll explain it to you, Mercer. Okay?

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please. He's very familiar with my flaws.

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He was too naturally talented.

102
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's... How tragic.

103
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop.

104
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's awful. Really.

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No. It's true. Okay?

106
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Everything has happened for him.
Without any effort, right?

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Born to great wealth.
Never needed to work a day in his life.

108
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So when he struggles,
he views this as a failure,

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
instead of part of the process. You see?

110
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, therapy.

111
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can't blame him.

112
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
His band made one album,
it helped define a generation.

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then he gives up music to paint,

114
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and his first show
gets the cover of Art Forum.

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, and every collector
from Miami to Beijing

116
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
is fighting over his pieces.

117
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Except, there's only one little problem...

118
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here we go. It's coming.

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They wait, but then there's no more art.

120
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's coming, the art is coming.

121
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just need a few more months...

122
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is what you always say to me,

123
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and so this is what I tell the buyers.

124
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But you know what? When there's nothing,
they look at me like I'm a liar.

125
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, I...

126
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Actually,

127
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm usually the one
on the phone dealing with the clients.

128
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You must have something
you're ready to show them.

129
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He spends all of his time in the studio.
He's there every day for hours?

130
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There are some things
that I am working on, yes.

131
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There are ideas. They're more like...
More of concepts, really.

132
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am very excited for them
to reach their potential.

133
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But, as I've said,
I need a little more time.

134
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No. Look, there is no more time, okay?

135
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Please. William,
people are starting to ask me if you died.

136
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What a bastard. Hey!
The more pent-up demand is, right?

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The higher the price is.

138
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come on. He's just being modest.

139
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He never thinks
anything he does is any good.

140
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, well, we will be the judge of that.

141
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ben.

142
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What does that mean? What are you doing?

143
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What? We're leaving.

144
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where are we going?

145
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're going to the studio.

146
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We all must see what it is
that you have been creating.

147
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm gonna get an espresso first, though.

148
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look, everyone is here
because we are rooting for you.

149
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right? We love you, William.

150
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Would you like anything else?

151
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No.

152
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come on. Let's go.

153
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go, get a cab.

154
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll meet you outside, okay?
I'm gonna hit the head.

155
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

156
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
My mom has night terrors.
Like, dreams where I die.

157
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it's hard for her to even let me
go to school, you know?

158
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Which means she hated Sam.

159
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
'Cause Sam pulled me into the world.

160
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Into Sam's world,
which is not exactly risk-free.

161
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So what happened was basically
Ramona Weisbarger's worst nightmare,

162
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
except it happened to Sam.

163
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No thanks to me.

164
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You really think
you could have protected her?

165
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Taken down a guy with a gun?

166
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No. I...

167
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But I would have taken a bullet
for her if I was there.

168
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Guilt.

169
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Explains why you've been
carrying this around.

170
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Charlie, the Prophet.

171
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No. I haven't even read it.

172
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not sure
if I'd even believe it if I did. But...

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
presumably, there's something
about forgiveness in there.

174
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's what you need right now?

175
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So bad I can hardly breathe.

176
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, Charlie. Okay, close your eyes.

177
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You think of Samantha.
Let the thought of her fill you up.

178
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, open your eyes.

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Look at me. Right at me. Don't look away.

180
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The Bible says that all sinners
who truly repent,

181
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
shall be granted great mercy
and forgiven all offenses.

182
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Doesn't matter what we've done,
or why we did it.

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is the law of God.

184
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, I'm no priest.

185
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Just a kid who paid attention
in Sunday school.

186
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But I am the only other guy here,

187
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
which means the job of absolution
falls on me.

188
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Charlie Weisbarger, I absolve you.

189
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are absolved.

190
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hey, kid, what happened to Sam
is not your fault. You hear me?

191
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Say it.

192
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

193
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nah, a little more like you mean it.

194
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

195
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You stand up and yell it.

196
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

197
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yell it.

198
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

199
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Louder!

200
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What happened to Sam was not my fault!

201
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Obviously, it's living
in a theoretical space.

202
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just beginning its life journey
into a more tangible form.

203
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So that's a stop sign?

204
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I mean, it was a stop sign,
but now it is a "spot" sign.

205
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Come on. Yo, just...

206
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Imagine encountering this
in the streets of New York City.

207
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, because the streets is the only place

208
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
where anyone is going to see
this piece of shit.

209
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you have anything else, William?

210
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean,
nothing that is as far along as this.

211
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Far along as a "spot" sign?
I don't understand, William.

212
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
After all the time
you've been spending here,

213
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
this is all you have to show for it?

214
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Please. Mercer, please. Okay?

215
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It is obvious he has been coming here
only to get high.

216
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not to mention
that you are high right now, huh?

217
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah. See? You have wasted my time.

218
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But worse, you are wasting your talent.

219
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Controversial, but I kind of love it.

220
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So, you shot up in the bathroom at Odeon?

221
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not like I could've just done it
right there at the table.

222
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
McNally sort of frowns at that.

223
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You said you were quitting.

224
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will.

225
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am, okay? Babe.
I really want to. I'm going to.

226
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What I want is to stop having this fight.

227
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How are we supposed to go on like this?

228
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe we're not supposed to.

229
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're going down a dark road, William.

230
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
One that ends in a "spot" sign

231
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and nothing else.

232
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Regan, we weren't expecting you, dear.

233
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Try the eggs. It's like eating a cloud.

234
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, I'm not staying.

235
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm just here because I thought
it might be nice for Daddy and I

236
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to walk into the office together.

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's gonna be a rough day for him,

238
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I thought people liked us.

239
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
People like scandal at anyone's expense.

240
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hi, honey.

241
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hi, Daddy. You're not dressed.

242
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Amory and Felicia didn't tell you?

243
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not going in today. Or ever.

244
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

245
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My failing. It's a condition of
his pretrial release.

246
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, I read the agreement
and it said nothing about him

247
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
not going into the office.

248
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was in a side memo
in case the agreement was leaked,

249
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
as it was, the fucking vultures.

250
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We'll call it retirement.
I've already started planning the party.

251
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A party.

252
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The only thing more important
than your father's defense is his health.

253
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This way, he can focus on both.

254
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The lawyers can come here to work.
Everything very private, comfortable.

255
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Dad, is that what you want?

256
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Darling, it's what everyone wants.

257
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You work hard to create a beautiful life,
then you finally get to enjoy it.

258
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The sooner the better, I say.

259
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You go, sweetie. Business as usual.

260
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The board needs to see
that you can handle things. Without me.

261
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, I'll call you. I love you.

262
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Love you too.

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you won't give me her number,
please just call her, it's important.

264
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Once again my name is M...

265
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mercer.

266
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Sorry, Mrs. Lamplighter.
I didn't realize that you knew him.

267
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, really? And why is that?

268
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was just stopping by to see my father.
What are you doing here?

269
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It was the only place I knew to find you.
It couldn't wait. It's William.

270
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We're having an intervention
at our apartment tonight.

271
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No. He's gonna hate that.

272
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Not as much as he'll hate being dead.

273
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's that bad?

274
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So I've just been tasked with finding
any of William's friends and family

275
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
who still care about him.

276
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

277
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I hope that includes you.

278
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sam is an artist.

279
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Used this place as her studio,
or maybe a storage locker,

280
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but not sure how any of this matters.

281
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
My instinct is Sam knew her shooter.

282
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This doesn't feel like a
"wrong place, wrong time" situation.

283
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Samantha wasn't assaulted.
Nothing was stolen.

284
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
First shot went wide,
second one got her, but didn't kill her.

285
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Fact that the shooter
didn't stick around to verify, you know,

286
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
very thankful for that,

287
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but it makes me think
that this was personal, but amateur.

288
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A shooter with a motive,
but not a lot of experience.

289
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, the way we find this perp is motive.

290
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That means learning everything
we can about your daughter.

291
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Got any kids?

292
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not yet. I'm working on it.

293
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Then you've no goddamn clue.

294
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Moment they're born,
you do everything you can to protect them,

295
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and then something like this happens.

296
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Look, Mr. Yeung.

297
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is the hardest thing
you're ever gonna go through.

298
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And everybody needs something to lean on.

299
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
To believe in. For me,
I believe in a father's love.

300
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I believe in you.

301
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We're gonna find who did this to her,
but not without your help.

302
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You know Samantha better than anyone.

303
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That one's her favorite.

304
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know, I think I heard
that music is good for people in comas.

305
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Keeps them connected.

306
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You find a cell phone?

307
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No. Did she have one?

308
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Never gave me her number,
but I saw her on it a couple times.

309
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Could be someone who didn't want us
to know who her friends were.

310
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll wanna see this.

311
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She calls it a zine.

312
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Was always working on it.

313
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Heading over to Kinko's all hours,
making copies.

314
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If you wanna know my daughter,
it's in there.

315
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, how'd you end up down here?

316
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I guess because I love roller coasters.

317
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My mom died when I was 16.

318
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No dad, so I just kind of drifted up north
from Louisiana after that.

319
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cleaned motel rooms from Memphis
to Nashville to Cincinnati.

320
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then I heard about Cedar Point
in Sandusky, Ohio.

321
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Figured a place with
18 world-class roller coasters

322
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and a water park couldn't be all bad.

323
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But I was wrong.

324
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know what you've heard
about cleaning motel rooms, Charlie,

325
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
but it's a low-pay, high-risk profession.

326
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Math only goes your way for so long.

327
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then what happens?

328
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then it goes the other way.

329
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So...

330
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that's why they call you Sewer Girl?

331
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
'Cause you were, like,
living in the gutters or...

332
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

333
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, Nicky says I'm stuck
on a lower level of consciousness.

334
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I still get sentimental
about cute animal pics

335
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and my horoscope and shit.

336
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He says I can pick a new name
once I evolve,

337
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but I don't know, kinda used to it.

338
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, sorry, what?
So, what's the deal with Nicky?

339
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I thought he was, like,
the lead singer in a cover band?

340
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You don't get it, Charlie.

341
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But you will. The band is the cover.

342
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Come with me.

343
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now.

344
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come on.

345
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay. This is the band's rehearsal space,
but we're converting it.

346
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
To what, you don't need to know.

347
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But all this equipment
goes into the basement,

348
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the window needs to be covered
and the carpet has to go.

349
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's a lot of carpet.

350
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then you better get started.

351
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wait, I'm doing this all by myself?

352
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Was this Nicky's idea?

353
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Nothing happens here
that isn't Nicky's idea.

354
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hey. Is that for me?

355
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's none of your goddamn business
is what it is.

356
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He was awkward. Like a puppy.
Sweet-eyed. Smiley.

357
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Maybe some freckles.

358
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And his hair was curly.
White boy curly. A mop.

359
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Like this?

360
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's him.

361
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Nailed it.
That kid's a fucking labradoodle.

362
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait. A shooting? What shooting?

363
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The... Right outside the party.
The girl in Central Park.

364
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Poor thing was an NYU student.

365
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mercer found her
and put his jacket over her.

366
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, it's like... It was William's jacket,
'cause he borrowed it.

367
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then when the cops found the drugs,

368
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
that's when Mercer realized
that William's a fucking junkie.

369
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is she okay, this girl?

370
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know anything else about her?

371
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I mean, she's in a coma.

372
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And they're not releasing
any other information.

373
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Apparently she's a freshman, I think.
I don't know.

374
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She's freshman.

375
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What difference does it make, really, right?

376
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're right. Yeah, it's tragic.

377
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.
I am so fucking nervous.

378
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I get it.

379
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hello.

380
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Regan,

381
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
there's an emergency board meeting.
We need to convene at the office.

382
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Tonight?

383
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Afraid so. It's time-sensitive.

384
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't. Just reschedule.

385
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, surely Keith can watch the children.

386
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
As we feared,

387
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the board is extremely concerned
about the charges against Bill.

388
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So then reassure them that he's innocent.

389
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can you get...?

390
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, I...

391
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Obviously, I have, strenuously, but...

392
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Kids.

393
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Amory, it's William.
He's in trouble, and I need to be there.

394
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
William.
I hadn't realized you'd connected.

395
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry to put you in this position

396
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
having to choose between your father
and your brother,

397
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but this is where we are.

398
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm here if you need me.

399
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Goodbye, Amory.

400
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If I wanted to share, I would. Okay.

401
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My dear, your favorite.

402
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Salmon.

403
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

404
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, my God. I cannot be late.
I have to go.

405
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But you're staying. Right, Mom?

406
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Which we should thank her for.

407
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I told you, Cate. Give it up.
They're not getting back together.

408
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, we don't know that.

409
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, we do.

410
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Still, there's nothing
more important than family.

411
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay?

412
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I love you both.

413
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Will, just try it, please.

414
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You got an eyeful today.
Like what you saw?

415
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't not like it.
I just don't understand.

416
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're Sol's girl, right?
So, are you with Nicky too, or what?

417
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I won't apologize for not conforming
to your delicate suburban sensibilities.

418
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Monogamy is just a tool of
patriarchal capitalism.

419
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That sounds exactly like something
that Sam would say,

420
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and that I would, like,
pretend to understand.

421
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sam is a believer.

422
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
A believer in what, sleeping around?

423
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you ask me, Sammy's saving herself.

424
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
For what?

425
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Who knows? Could be you, Charlie man.

426
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey. Come over here.

427
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
When we started this revolution,
we knew it would have a cost.

428
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And tonight, we celebrate
a wounded warrior fighting for her life.

429
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
To Sam. Tonight's for her.

430
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
To Sammy.

431
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
To Sam.

432
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
To Sammy.

433
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sam.

434
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's for Sam? What are we doing?

435
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We don't even know this fucking kid.

436
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He has had a rather rapid ascent
into our good graces,

437
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
but what does he bring
to the table, really?

438
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sam likes him.

439
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah? Well, she didn't tell him shit.
So, why should we?

440
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All right, well, whatever Sam knew,
I wanna know too.

441
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Knock me out. Lock me up.
Force me into hard labor.

442
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Whatever. I'm all in.

443
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, shit.

444
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's all in.

445
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Guess we'll see about that.

446
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The zero hour is upon us.

447
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's have some fun.

448
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Relax. William wouldn't knock.

449
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right.

450
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hi.

451
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hey.

452
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you so much for coming.

453
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Uh-huh.

454
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Regan, this is Venus De Nylon.

455
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hi. I'm William's sister.

456
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Didn't know he had a sister.

457
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Venus played keyboard for Ex Post Facto.

458
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Had to represent.

459
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Everyone from the original band's
either more fucked up than Billy,

460
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
hates him or is already dead.

461
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, we who are living
will have to do everything that we can.

462
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hello. Hi.

463
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come.

464
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Have a seat.

465
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Thanks.

466
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hey.

467
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I just wanted to say thank you

468
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
for being there for William
when no one else was.

469
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Of course.

470
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, everyone ready?

471
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

472
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

473
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Any moment now,
William's gonna walk through that door,

474
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and he is probably not gonna like
what he sees.

475
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because you're here to tell him
that you love him.

476
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Love makes people accountable.

477
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hey, you've reached Sam.
Please leave a message,

478
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
or you can do it the old-fashioned way
and page me.

479
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The mailbox is full
and cannot accept any messages...

480
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hello.

481
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey, Mrs. Santos.

482
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I hope I haven't called too late.

483
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hello, William. My name's Earl.

484
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
These good folks here gathered today

485
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because they're afraid
that you're gonna die.

486
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Would you like to have a seat?

487
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, Earl, I would not.

488
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, listen. This was my idea, William.

489
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So you can be mad at me, but mostly,
you need to be mad at yourself.

490
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because your addiction
is diminishing your work as an artist,

491
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but your lying,
your lying is diminishing you as a person.

492
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So please, please don't act like
you are better than this.

493
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're done?

494
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Earl here is just doing his job.
And I appreciate that.

495
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Fuck. I mean, Bruno, I understand.

496
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have nothing for you to sell,

497
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and therefore I am of no value to you.

498
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But you, babe.

499
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You?

500
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Did you really think this was gonna work?

501
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He didn't think this would work.

502
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He's just running out of ways
to show you that he loves you.

503
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Who are you exactly?

504
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't... Please don't do that.

505
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm impressed.

506
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hey, Reegs.

507
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What... What has it been, 15 years, right?

508
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah. Give or take.

509
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's how long it took me to find you.

510
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Really?

511
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't do that. Don't go. No.

512
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I miss you.

513
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, my God.

514
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, I miss you so much.

515
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can't do this right now. I can't.

516
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I never stopped missing you.

517
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I wasn't that hard to find.

518
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So whatever this is...

519
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No.

520
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was in a band. We made an album.

521
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I know.

522
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I had a show at a gallery
that was reviewed

523
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
by The New York fucking Times.

524
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I was never more
than 20 minutes away from you.

525
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You could have walked.

526
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I had a family. I had two kids.
I was married. I had a job. I was...

527
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I was right fucking there.

528
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Right where you left me. Right there.

529
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Where...

530
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Where I left you.

531
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I wanted you to come with me.

532
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I fucking begged you to come with me.
I just wanted to protect you.

533
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I wanted our father to protect you.

534
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I didn't know what else to do.
I was hanging on by a fucking thread.

535
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I had to find a way to survive. I didn't...

536
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, congratulations, Reegs...

537
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Please.

538
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
...that you survived. You did it.

539
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Please.

540
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't have to do anything.

541
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I love you.

542
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't even know these people,

543
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but I wish you understood
how much I love you.

544
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you know that Dad is sick?

545
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Dad?

546
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you know that he would
welcome you back with open fucking arms?

547
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Daddy is a fucking coward.

548
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are a coward.

549
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
All of you, everyone here
is a fucking coward! Okay?

550
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What, and shooting dope
is your idea of bravery?

551
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're so fucking cool, aren't you?

552
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Sounds like there is a lot to discuss.
So let's all sit and just have some tea.

553
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You see, this is why I came home.

554
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I remembered it was here.
So, thank you all very much.

555
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
William, you can change your whole life
right now with just one decision.

556
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Please, William,
will you just listen to him?

557
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm begging you. You'll thank me...

558
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Shut up! Please stop!

559
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Stop. Mercer.

560
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So, if I leave with Earl here,
it's the only way you'll love me?

561
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't want that kind of love.

562
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, thank you. I don't want that.

563
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm so sorry.

564
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey, Tony. How you doing?

565
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Listen, I'm heading to Aspen
with the family tonight.

566
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I could drop the paperwork on the way.

567
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, thank you. Is that gonna work?
I got it with me.

568
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay. All right, great.
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

569
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Looking for something?

570
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm guessing you want this back.

571
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm Sam.

572
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hey, Sam.

573
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hi.

574
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is so wrong. Let's go anywhere else.

575
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No.

576
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's a W in Union Square.

577
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is way more fun.
There are no boys allowed after 11:00.

578
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Boys?

579
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

580
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sam.

581
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Your roommate's panda fetish
isn't making this any less weird.

582
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She's in Des Moines for the holidays,

583
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
so you can focus on me, not her.

584
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

585
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What about you? What are you into?

586
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
'Cause it looks like you
don't even live here.

587
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm into you. And you know where I live.

588
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Speaking of...

589
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah?

590
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now that I know you, I realized I don't...

591
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't really know you.
A married finance guy.

592
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How did you end up on my doorstep?

593
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're not the only one with secrets.

594
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who, me? I'm an open book.

595
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's the biggest lie you've told yet.
Look how easily it came.

596
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tell me who you work for.

597
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No one. I'm self-employed.

598
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Everyone answers to someone.

599
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Hi.

600
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hey.

601
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's my door.

602
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right.

603
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Panda lover from Des Moines.

604
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm a friend of Samantha's.

605
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was just wondering if you knew
how she's doing,

606
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
or if you've seen her
in the last couple of days.

607
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, the cops wondered that too.

608
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The cops were here?

609
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I...

610
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey, can I ask you...

611
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sam told me she was gonna
be a senior this fall.

612
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No.
She started last fall. She's a freshman.

613
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey. I can do lunch tomorrow. Okay.

614
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Tim, I appreciate
that you've always had my back.

615
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Thank you. We'll stay in touch.
All right, thank you.

616
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Regan,
how did the reunion go with William?

617
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It was short-lived.
And I see I'm too late.

618
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Not at all. Amory has swooped in
and saved the day.

619
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He's interim chair until we can find
a suitable replacement for your father.

620
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The board is very happy.
The ship has been steadied.

621
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, or hijacked.

622
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean,
you force my father into retirement

623
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and then the CEO job
just falls right into your lap.

624
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Interim. Until we can find
a permanent replacement.

625
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry things didn't go so well
with your brother.

626
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But I need you too, now more than ever.

627
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We need each other.

628
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll see you in the morning.

629
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

630
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't.

631
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Come on, Prophet. Front and center.

632
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Come here. Hey.

633
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

634
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Ne cede malis. Means "yield not to evil."

635
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's the motto of the Bronx. Come on.

636
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Fucking beautiful.

637
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What's the matter, Charlie man?

638
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't understand what we're doing here.

639
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sam loves music. She's not into violence.

640
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She'd never hurt anybody.

641
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And neither would we.

642
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's okay, Charlie.
No one lives in that building.

643
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Then why?

644
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sam asked the same questions you are.

645
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I tried my best to answer.
We love this city.

646
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We think it should belong
to the musicians and the artists.

647
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To the Black and the brown folks.

648
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
To the dreamers, the junkies, the poets.

649
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But some very bad people
are trying to take that away from us, and...

650
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
we're just fighting back.

651
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
By setting it on fire?

652
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hey, you're gonna have to trust me, Prophet.

653
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There's a plan.

654
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
A plan to keep this city for the people

655
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and lock up those bastards
who are stealing our island.

656
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We're building a new world

657
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that requires the destruction
of the old one.

658
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Also, it feels really fucking good
to blow shit up.

659
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So fucking good.

660
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hell yeah.

661
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We sang songs about it.

662
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If the question you're asking is,
"What would Sam do?"

663
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I think we all know the answer.
Sam was one of us,

664
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and you're not gonna get closer
to the truth of what happened to her

665
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
running in the other direction.

666
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come on, Charlie. Join us.
Show Sam what you're made of.

667
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Police are looking for a Caucasian male
between 15 and 25.

668
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Medium height, slim build,
dark hair and eyes.

669
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Anyone with information,

670
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
please call the NYPD at 212-111-TIPS.

671
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
As shootings in the park...

672
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Skinny kid, bushy hair.

673
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like a poodle died on his head.

674
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He wasn't a kid. He was, like, 40.

675
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Preppy, clean-cut, Rolex.

676
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm gonna go pull that tape.

677
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If it's not the 28 jeans kid,
then who the hell is it?

678
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Come with me.

679
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

680
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hey.

681
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The kid in the photo,
his mother called in.

682
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay, yeah. I'll head right over.

683
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Summers in Southampton.
So many good memories.

684
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Some things are better left forgotten.

685
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Come on, Charlie.

686
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Come on, Prophet.

687
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can do it, Charlie. Breathe.

688
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do it.

689
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We believe in you.

690
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Come on.

691
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't even think about it.

692
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Come on, Prophet.

693
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Just throw it.

694
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We can head out.

695
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's go.

696
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

697
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Come on, Charlie man.

698
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Come on, Charlie man! Come on!

699
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Keith?

700
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So, what was so urgent
that it couldn't wait till morning?

701
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is where the girl was shot.

702
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, I saw the police from the party.

703
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You have a special interest in this case?

704
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was just won... I mean...

705
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think I know who she is.

706
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I was wondering if you knew if...

707
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
if you...

708
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you knew about...

709
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Keith, what is there to know
about a young girl

710
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and a married man
who owes his good fortune,

711
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
not to mention his actual fortune,
to his lovely wife's family?

712
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Surely such a man wouldn't mix business
with that kind of pleasure.

713
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No. That wouldn't be smart.

714
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It would be pure stupidity.
It would be dangerous even.

715
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Jesus, Amory.

716
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What happened here, is it because of you?

717
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come on, Keith.

718
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We both know that what happened here...

719
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is because of you.
