1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He finds Rojas and it's there!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Richmond have beaten
Aston Villa three-nil,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
with an offensive display
as dazzling as it is unfamiliar.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
AFC Richmond make it
two decisive wins in a row.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Southampton never knew what hit them.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Bumbercatch with a 95th-minute winner
over Tottenham.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The dog track has gone absolutely potty!

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Another sensational win
for Richmond away at Everton.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's four in a row. Amazing.
Life is good for the Greyhounds.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a lucky streak.
What goes up always comes down.

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Exciting times on Nelson Road,

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and you have to think that no one
is happier than Coach Ted Lasso.

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm glad this little trip
worked out for y'all.

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah. Henry's really excited
to spend the weekend with you.

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, yeah. Well, you know…

16
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'll take face-to-face time
over FaceTime anytime.

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah. And you know, I wanna say,
it's been nice to…

18
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Get to remeet you, Dr. Jacob.

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ted, please. I insist, just call me Jake.

20
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You got it, Jake.

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, nope. Still feels weird to me,
you know?

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Like whenever I hear white
folks call Jay-Z "Jigga man," you know?

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Or like when you see
a priest wearing shorts.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, exactly. Weird, you know?

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Or when you get pulled over
by a cop who's the same age as you.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're like, "Come on, man, be cool."

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
"What we doing here?" You know?

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Can I get some more money
for the pinball, please?

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, let's see...

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah.

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You go. You go ahead.

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay.

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know what I have. Let's see.

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are some magnets I gotta bring back
to work and a matchbook.

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and a complimentary sleep mask that
did not fit 'cause I have a huge head.

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come on, Prince Henry. I rigged
the machine so you can play without coins.

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You said that was impossible.

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Here you go.
Two English breakfasts. Enjoy.

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you.

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Nothing's impossible.

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I should wash my hands
'cause I touched dirty money.

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He's a hand-wash guy.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, better safe than sorry.

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah. Right?

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you sure you're not hungry?

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, I'm good.

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I had a big old piece of cereal at home.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

49
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah.

50
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But please, help yourself.

51
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're gonna need your strength,
hiking around that English countryside.

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, yeah. About that.

53
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah?

54
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Jake told me on the plane
he's actually taking me to Paris.

55
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It was a surprise.

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Paris.

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Great, yeah. Which one?

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You know, Paris, Texas? Paris, Arkansas?
Paris, Ohio? Or the other Paris in Ohio?

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Actually,
I think there's three Parises in Ohio.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or do you say "Parese"? Par...

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
"Paris" Paris. You know, in France.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The default Paris.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Right.

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Cool. Well, that's gonna be real…

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I wish I knew the French word for "nice."

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Très bien.

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Très bien.

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You know, I think hooking up with you
might just be my favorite thing ever.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah?

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah. Well, second favorite.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Go on then.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sorry.

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There goes my boner.

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My dad told my Uncle Bernie I'm in town,

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and he's invited me to his big, swanky
polo event tomorrow. Would you wanna go?

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The one time I've been on a horse
was for a photo shoot years ago.

77
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Horse was so drugged up that it could've
been the guitarist in the Sex Pistols.

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, we don't play.

79
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We just stand around and drink champagne.

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, right. Of course, yeah.

81
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's for charity.

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You know, celebrities,
red carpet, big trays of tiny food.

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a whole thing. We should go.

84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Be fun to show off my girlfriend.

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sounds great. And it gives me
an excuse to go to Harvey Nicks!

86
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, I'll tell Uncle Bernie.
He's gonna love you.

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I didn't know your dad had a brother.

88
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No, sorry.
"Uncle" Bernie is a family friend.

89
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bernard Arnault. He runs...

90
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Moët and Louis Vuitton!

91
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Does he need another fake niece?

92
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can ask him yourself tomorrow.

93
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's very cool.

94
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
More importantly…

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Where were we?

96
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Champagne.

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Harvey Nicks.

98
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Fake uncles.

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Drugged horses.

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, fuck.

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey. Morning.

102
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Morning.

103
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That was nice.

104
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You staying over, I mean. Not the…

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, that... Obviously, that was nice
as well. I don't...

106
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your breath smells good.

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you.

108
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Did you go off and brush your teeth
and then sneak back into bed?

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, I did.

110
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Does my breath smell awful?

111
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, it does, ac...

112
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, it is quite bad.

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, look, would you want to go
and grab some breakfast?

114
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You know, I don't have

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
any meals planned with anybody else
in the foreseeable future.

116
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know. Do you?

117
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, I don't.

118
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So if someone were to ask about us,

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
what terminology would you
best recommend describes our relationship?

120
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, there's no pressure to label us…

121
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You and I. I just... Yeah.

122
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right.

123
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

124
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, no, 'cause I'm just cool.

125
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just cool and casual. I just...

126
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Me too. Wait. Did you shave?

127
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, and showered. After I used
the toilet in next door's flat.

128
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Weird.

129
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wow.

130
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hi, baby. I know you're all the way up
there in chilly Newcastle,

131
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
so here's a little something
to warm you up.

132
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Nope. You're right. I shouldn't watch it.

133
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Shit. How did that get on the Internet?
A private video that...

134
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Apparently, there's been some
massive leak. It's not just you.

135
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's actresses, singers,
a couple politicians,

136
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
some random reality show guy
with a very big dick.

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, my God. I can't believe
this is happening. I...

138
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How did that... Fuck! Fuck.

139
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey. Hey, hey.

140
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No, this is bad, because my friends
are gonna see this. My family.

141
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The team.

142
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Take a breath.

143
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, my God, and the office.
I'm their boss.

144
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Keeley, stop. Take a breath.

145
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

146
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm so sorry this is happening.

147
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna take care of it, okay?

148
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

149
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, Henry. We have scored excellently
on kit presentation.

150
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hanger integrity: Insane.

151
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But we did drop a little
on the towel folding, didn't we?

152
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But that's okay. I've been there.
But that does lead us on to our next task,

153
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
which is towel placement.

154
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The question is, are you ready?

155
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

156
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you steady?

157
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

158
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In that case, go!

159
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is this a game or child labor?

160
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In late-stage capitalism,
what's the difference?

161
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Word.

162
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're doing really well, Henry.

163
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then we'll go into the weight room and do
some cleaning next. That'll be great.

164
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, fellas, let me ask you something.

165
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you could propose to someone,
you know, anywhere in the world,

166
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
where would you do it?

167
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Paris.

168
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The Hall of Mirrors
at Linderhof Palace in Germany,

169
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
because if she agreed,
I'd be surrounded by a thousand yeses.

170
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or Paris. Why?

171
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Dr. Jacob is gonna propose to Michelle.

172
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.

174
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you wanna talk about it?

175
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, I do.

176
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Diamond Dogs, mount up!

177
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Never fucking mind.

178
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What... what's going on?
What... What's the Diamond Dogs?

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a living fucking nightmare!

180
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The Diamond Dogs are a group of men
committed to supporting each other

181
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
by sharing their most intimate thoughts,
feelings and experiences. You in or out?

182
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm in.

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Goddamn it!

184
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Roy chose "out."

185
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, I assumed.

186
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sorry, just...

187
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just came as fast as I could.

188
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Take your time.

189
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey, we appreciate your expediency.

190
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I got a bit light-headed.

191
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Balance. Okay. I am okay.

192
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
First order of business: New member.

193
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Coach, you have the floor.

194
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Dr. Jacob and Michelle
are getting engaged.

195
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a hard moment when an ex moves on.

196
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Did he at least ask your permission?

197
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, I'm her ex-husband,
not her current father.

198
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, no, he... No.

199
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Can you believe that?

200
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's it?

201
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Unbelievable.

202
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

203
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ted, I ran down the stairs for this
and up some other stairs.

204
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm gonna have leg cramps
in my sleep tonight.

205
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, now, hold on a second, okay?
This is happening, all right?

206
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My man took Michelle to Paris
on a surprise trip.

207
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why else would he do that?

208
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can I just talk whenever?

209
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, he's right, Ted.

210
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can't worry about something
that hasn't happened yet.

211
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What he said. If anything,
you should find out before you flip out.

212
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
"Find out before you flip out," huh?

213
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, okay. No, that... Yeah, you're right.

214
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Of course. Thank you. Yeah. Hey.

215
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right. Anybody else got something?

216
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Roy,
you got anything you wanna talk about?

217
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Fuck you.

218
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

219
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All right. Well, Diamond Dogs,
disperse then.

220
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Woof!

221
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Am I in trouble?

222
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, nothing like that. No. Promise.

223
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

224
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, no, that's okay.

225
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, thank you for coming.
Just take a seat. Thank you.

226
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Just waiting on one more.

227
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There you go.

228
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Are we in trouble?

229
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No. Nobody's in trouble. Just…

230
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, you know, I just don't wanna say it
until everyone's here, so…

231
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll call. It's fine. I'll just call.

232
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hello, Coach Shelley.

233
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello, Ms. Kakes.

234
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I just wondered if Rupert was on his way
to my office for our special meeting.

235
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, he's not coming to that.

236
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I mean, he said that he would,
so... I mean, is he busy?

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No.

238
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's fine. Don't worry.
I guess it's just us then.

239
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For the very first meeting of the...
Drumroll, please.

240
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Love Hounds.

241
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

242
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, I'd love to talk about the stresses
of taking care of my aging parents.

243
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, I'll start.

244
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So I... I've started seeing this girl,
and it's going real well.

245
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I really like her. She's great.

246
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
or whether to let her know just how
strongly I feel about us being together.

247
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Disco, would you...
Do you got any thoughts or...

248
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I've been divorced three times.

249
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Never let them know how you feel.
It's very expensive.

250
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

251
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, this meeting's over,
and it'll probably never happen again.

252
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you for coming. Thank you both.

253
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are we in trouble now?

254
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, Roger. Just go. No. Thank you.

255
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's all right.

256
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey, Boss.

257
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Morning, Ted.

258
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Here you go.

259
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Morning. Thank you.

260
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I could use your help.

261
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Of course. Anything. Wait.
Shouldn't you be at training?

262
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, yeah, but don't worry.
I've got that all covered.

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Go, go, go, go!

264
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Right. Okay, then. Well, how can I help?

265
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I need to hire a private investigator.

266
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why?

267
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
'Cause Dr. Jacob took Michelle
to Paris, the French one,

268
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and I'm pretty sure he's gonna propose.

269
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now I gotta find out if I'm right
so I don't flip out when I am.

270
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ted, people visit Paris
for all kinds of reasons.

271
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, like getting engaged.

272
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No. They go to eat the amazing food...

273
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
After getting engaged.

274
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

275
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Or they go to see Oscar Wilde's grave.

276
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Before they get engaged.

277
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No.

278
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah. Where'd you and Rupert get engaged?

279
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That doesn't matter.

280
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
See, that's what I'm talking about.

281
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Right now,
Dr. Romance is probably getting ready

282
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, please. The Eiffel Tower
is just a lamppost with a publicist.

283
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Rebecca, come on. I just need to know
what's going on with them.

284
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Please help me.

285
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, Ted. I'll make the call.

286
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay. Thank you.

287
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

288
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I didn't know Oscar Wilde was dead.

289
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Some of his quotes feel so modern,
so of our time.

290
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know. Powerful.

291
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

292
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come in.

293
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is now a good time, Ms. Jones?

294
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, of course. Yeah.

295
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry about what happened.

296
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you, Barbara.

297
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a statement.

298
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
"Allow me to first offer
my sincere apologies."

299
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I deeply regret that video
that some of you have seen online.

300
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
"I'm beyond embarrassed, and I should have
never made this video in the first place."

301
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
"I hope you can forgive me
while I learn and grow."

302
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Jack thought you could post it
across your socials.

303
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But maybe not Facebook,
'cause that's just for

304
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
grandparents and racists now, isn't it?

305
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, Jamie? Jamie? Can I get some Lynx?

306
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, sure, mate. What's your pit flavor?
I've got Epic Fresh, Sport Recharge, Java,

307
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Africa, Ice Chill, Gold, Excite, Black,
Dark Temptation and Leather and Cookies.

308
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Leather and Cookies, please.

309
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Smart choice for a smart boy.

310
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There you go.

311
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Lovely stuff.

312
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
'Ey. Have you smelled this?

313
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yo! Yo, y'all see this? A bunch of famous
chicks got their nude photos leaked.

314
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, wow.

315
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey, The Sun is calling
it "The Great A-wank-ening."

316
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What is the opposite of clever?

317
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The Sun.

318
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, I guess I know
what I'm doing this weekend.

319
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because it wasn't meant for us,
Jan Maas. It was their private property.

320
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Nah, bro. If you don't want
your private pictures out there,

321
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
just don't take naked pictures.

322
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

323
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Especially being famous.

324
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What? Come on, man.

325
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's that simple.

326
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Fuck that, Cowburn. No, man.

327
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The only people to blame are the dickheads
who steal your shit and put it online.

328
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's why I delete all the photos
on my phone.

329
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I swear down.
Especially 'cause I'm famous.

330
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey, listen. I'm with Jamie on this one.

331
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
delete any photos, videos.
Whatever she wants.

332
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bro, for real?

333
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah. I'm being serious.

334
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know,
one girl actually deleted Candy Crush.

335
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was devastated, but I also understood.

336
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey, hold on. Once someone sends you
a photo, don't you own it?

337
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Copyright law on private photography
is quite murky.

338
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not about the law. It's about doing
what is right. Like in Les Misérables.

339
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Jean Valjean.

340
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Fuck yeah, 24601.

341
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No. 'Ey, deleting photos makes no sense.

342
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What? Do we delete our memories too?

343
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, 'cause no one can steal your memories.

344
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's not entirely true.

345
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

346
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nah.

347
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What if I took the photo?

348
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You should delete it.

349
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What if it was a Christmas card?

350
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Delete it, bro.

351
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What if it's artsy?

352
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What the fuck does that mean?

353
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's in black-and-white.
You can't see anything.

354
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Delete it, mate.

355
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What if I'm in the photo?

356
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Delete it.

357
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know. What about sonograms?

358
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Delete that shit.

359
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What if I'm French?

360
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Delete it.

361
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What if she's naked, but not sexual?

362
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What the fuck? What is she doing in it?

363
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She's just defecating.

364
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Delete it, bro.

365
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What about a commissioned painting?

366
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is it in a nice frame?

367
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's leaning against my couch.

368
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Gotta burn it, bro.

369
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, I shouldn't have to delete my
photos just because they might get stolen.

370
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's my stuff. Don't touch it.

371
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm with that. That makes sense.

372
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey, guys.

373
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This article says Keeley
was one of the women who was hacked.

374
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right. Everybody, take out your phones.

375
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Delete every single picture and video
that you've ever been sent. Now!

376
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're all targets for this shit.
So delete everything.

377
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But we're professional footballers.
It could take days.

378
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If not weeks.

379
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now!

380
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey, man, take out your phone.

381
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Colin. I wasn't playing.
I told you to delete that shit.

382
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I will, man. Fuck off.

383
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I said delete it right now.

384
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey! Hey.

385
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Fuck off.

386
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This whole thing is so fucking upsetting.
I tried to watch the video this morning,

387
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and immediately, boom,
I was right back to being 15 again,

388
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
reliving that moment
where this topless photo I took

389
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
for Jimmy Daniels
was being passed around at school.

390
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Teenage boys can be awful.

391
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mr. Daniels was my teacher.

392
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, men who act like teenage boys
actually are awful.

393
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm not an idiot.

394
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I know there are tons of topless photos
of me online. But those were my choice.

395
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Absolutely. It makes a huge difference.

396
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

397
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Is there anything I can do to help?

398
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Restructure society so women
aren't constantly sexualized

399
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
while simultaneously being crucified
for being sexual?

400
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
On it.

401
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Should I be ashamed or embarrassed?

402
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What?

403
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know.

404
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
How did Jack respond?

405
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, she was really lovely.

406
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then I got this from her.

407
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She didn't write this.

408
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You don't think so?

409
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, it's caked in lawyer ick.

410
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Then tell her that.
Give her a chance to surprise you.

411
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you.

412
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, there might be
a silver lining in all this.

413
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Just think of how many young women you are
going to teach how to masturbate properly.

414
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

415
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm serious.

416
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Back in the day,
I didn't have a clue what I was doing.

417
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then one day I accidentally bumped
into my parents' couch

418
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and it felt nice, so I stuck with it.

419
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A year later, my mum
had to have everything reupholstered.

420
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I blamed the dog.

421
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, that was smart.

422
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, we didn't have a dog.

423
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I love you.

424
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've got you.

425
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Also, French sisters.

426
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Spanish twins.

427
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mom and daughter in Mexico.

428
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll miss you all. Merci.

429
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hi. Thank you, love. Bye.

430
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hi. Yeah.

431
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oi, Keeley.

432
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hi.

433
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey.

434
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I heard about what happened.
It's fucking shit.

435
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, on so many levels.

436
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm so sorry.

437
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thanks, Roy.

438
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You okay?

439
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
All things considered, yeah. Yeah.

440
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good.

441
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And you?

442
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Me, yeah, I'm good.

443
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Who was it for?

444
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What?

445
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The video. Who was it for?

446
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Shit, I'm sorry, Keeley. I'm really sorry.

447
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's okay.

448
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Fuck.

449
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Fuck.

450
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Babe?

451
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In here.

452
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey.

453
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How you doing?

454
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Better. Worse. Everything.

455
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I got your statement.

456
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, I'm sorry. I called my dad
for advice, and his lawyers got involved.

457
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's corporate fuckery at its finest.

458
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yet, you had Barbara give it to me.

459
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, I tried to pick the most sensitive,
empathetic person I knew.

460
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Jack, I can't do it.

461
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I get it.

462
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm just so sorry
you have to deal with all of this shit.

463
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry that you have to too.

464
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How about, for the next few hours,
we pretend none of this shit happened?

465
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Should we invite Barbara over?
Mess it all up?

466
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, let's definitely do that.

467
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll bet she's a party animal.

468
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You actually have no idea.

469
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Really?

470
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, yeah.

471
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
"Asim was right, Marcus thought."

472
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They were failing, and worse than that,
they were wasting time.

473
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They were gonna wait another day
before meeting?

474
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That would only leave two days,
and one of them was Saturday,

475
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
when they wouldn't be at Breakfast Club.

476
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What if he never got his football
back from the creature? What if...

477
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
A large hand landed on Marcus's shoulder,

478
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and he spun around
to find Mr. Anderson looking down at him.

479
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
"'I heard you went under the fence, '
he said."

480
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, boy.

481
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We're gonna stop there for the night.
Cliff-hanger.

482
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey, how was your flight out?

483
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Good.

484
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah?

485
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Do you know I have the most
air miles of any kid in my school?

486
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, yeah?

487
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, that don't surprise me.

488
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Things at school good though?
You and Doug back on track and all that?

489
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

490
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We're starting a band.

491
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Starting a band? Really?

492
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All right.
What instrument are you gonna play?

493
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Drums.

494
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Drums.

495
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay. Well, your mom's gonna love that.

496
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know what?
Now might be a good time to let you know

497
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that Dave Grohl
learned to play drums on pillows.

498
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We don't have to tell your mom that
though right away.

499
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, exactly.

500
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Not as fun.

501
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Getting all your homework done?

502
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I have to, or I can't watch TV.

503
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Of course. You know how it goes.

504
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Homework. Dinner. TV time.

505
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Homework. Dinner. TV time.

506
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's right.

507
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Good system.

508
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Does…

509
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Does Dr. Jacob ever, you know,
hang out around TV time with you?

510
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Who is that?

511
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No. Sorry. Jake. Mom's friend, Jake.

512
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sometimes.

513
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sometimes, yeah.

514
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah. That's all right.

515
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Does he ever…

516
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Read to you, like, at night?
Like, bedtime?

517
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's totally fine.

518
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Nothing wrong with that,
I think that's great.

519
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's good to have people in your life that
are excited to be around you, you know?

520
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Especially if, you know…

521
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's someone who makes your mom happy
and all that.

522
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Which he seems to do.

523
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You guys get along all right?

524
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Come on, man.

525
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Good morning.

526
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Holy shit.

527
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't wanna wake you, so I went out
and did some cheeky retail therapy.

528
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I loved it so much,
I didn't want to take it off.

529
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What do you think?

530
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You look incredible.

531
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I mean, nothing but the best
for our dear Uncle Bernie, right?

532
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Shit.

533
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Babe, I canceled that.

534
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry. I should've asked.

535
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I thought I was doing the right thing.

536
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No. Don't apologize.

537
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're right. Thank you.
I didn't think about that.

538
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But you know what?

539
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Leave it on, and I'll put on
my own killer fucking outfit,

540
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and we can go do something stupid
and fun and look amazing while doing it.

541
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, okay.

542
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No, actually, take it off.

543
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, my God.

544
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Keep the hat on, but…

545
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Jesus.

546
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
…everything else is definitely coming off.

547
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We're talking no game,
no scouting, no nothing.

548
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The world is our oyster.

549
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay. Well, how about
the world is our shrimp cocktail?

550
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, great.

551
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All right, Coach. What are our options?

552
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There is a immersive
Jack the Ripper walking tour

553
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that Jane's been raving about.

554
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's, like, six hours long,
and at one point, you get chased.

555
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you nuts? I mean, he's a boy.

556
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Fine, there's the London Eye.
There's the Tower of London.

557
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There's all the London stuff.

558
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's a rave in Peckham.

559
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, Coach, I appreciate it.

560
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hey, big guy, what do you wanna do?
We could go to some museums.

561
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I wanna go see a football game.

562
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

563
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let me see if I got this straight.

564
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
My one day off from football,
you wanna go watch football?

565
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a little bit like asking a mailman
to go for a walk on his day off,

566
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
don't you think?

567
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, you don't care. You're just a little
boy, ambivalent as all heck. Okay.

568
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Coach, we got any games in town today?

569
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's one.

570
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, there you go.

571
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But I'm gonna have to stop at home first.

572
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Look. There he is, there.

573
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hey, Nate!

574
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Nate!

575
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Nate!

576
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Coach, look who came to watch.

577
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Nate!

578
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Must be looking for tips.

579
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He saw me, Dad. He saw me.

580
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, he did. He heard you too.

581
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Holy shit.

582
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, what can I say?
I'm the daughter of a billionaire.

583
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I learned to read a green
before I learned to read a book.

584
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, you might be a great golfer,
but I happen to be a really great cheater.

585
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So I think that makes us even.

586
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Watch out!

587
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, my goodness, it's a tie.

588
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Uh-huh?

589
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes, look.

590
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Isn't this way better than watching
polo with a bunch of old white men?

591
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Definitely.

592
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I reckon the dinosaurs here
are much less handsy.

593
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, yeah, the dinosaurs are.

594
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I can't say the same
for some other people.

595
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, yeah?

596
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah.

597
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Jack?

598
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sorry. Excuse me.

599
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, my...

600
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hi.

601
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Look at you. Nice suit.

602
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you doing here?

603
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
My sister's hen do.

604
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She's marrying a golfer.

605
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A professional?

606
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, no. He just golfs.

607
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hello.

608
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is Alyssa. We went to uni together.

609
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And this is my friend, Keeley Jones.

610
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Hi.

611
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hi.

612
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Keeley runs a PR firm.

613
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You or your family ever need anyone,
this is who you want.

614
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's me.

615
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Cool.

616
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Alyssa! Come on!

617
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Coming, Sis!

618
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hurry up!

619
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Come on.

620
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Fucking families.

621
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Anyway, it was nice to see you, Jack.

622
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, you too.

623
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Love the hat.

624
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thanks. Yeah.

625
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
All right, let's make things
a little more interesting, shall we?

626
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ten pounds a hole,
but I will spot you 20 strokes.

627
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're on.

628
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But no cheating.

629
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Then only a pound a hole.

630
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Great match, Coach.

631
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hello, my darlings.

632
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hey, Mae.

633
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What have you three been up to today?

634
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We went to the West Ham game.

635
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then you don't drink in this pub.

636
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hey, come on, Mae.

637
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's a child.

638
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey!

639
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Mae!

640
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

641
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You think I wanted to fucking be there?

642
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You two are on probation.

643
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Fair enough.

645
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Bye, Mae.

646
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Dad.

647
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah?

648
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Listen.

649
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What?

650
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The Beatles.

651
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, yeah.

652
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hey, you know what? I'll be right back.

653
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hey, Boss, what do you got for me?

654
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Right. Ted, listen, I want you to know,
you do not have to go down this road.

655
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I know, but I need to, okay?

656
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
'Cause right now,
Michelle and this Dr. Jacob fella

657
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
could be sitting there, having dinner
at one of her favorite Parisian hotels,

658
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
like the George Sank…

659
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Cinq.

660
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
…or the Plaza Anthony.

661
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Athénée. Hold on.

662
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Her favorite hotels in Paris?
I thought you said she'd never been there.

663
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, she hasn't. But the George Stank…

664
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Cinq.

665
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
…Is from her favorite movie, French Kiss,

666
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and the Plaza Anthony...

667
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Athénée.

668
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait, what's all that noise?
Where are you?

669
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sounds like someone's singing.

670
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wh... No, I'm sorry.
I'm at a pub with Beard and Henry.

671
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why? Is it too loud?
I can step away further if that helps.

672
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No, it's fine.

673
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Where were we?

674
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You think I'm nuts.

675
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thanks, Michael.

676
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So, you like The Beatles, huh?

677
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why is that?

678
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
'Cause my dad does.

679
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know what this song's about?

680
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Someone named Jude.

681
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Not just someone. A little boy named Jude.

682
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And one day his mom and dad decided
to break up. You know, get divorced.

683
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And that made Jude real, real sad.

684
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Now, Jude's dad had a best friend,

685
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and that best friend was real worried
about Jude and all his sad feelings.

686
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So he wrote him this song,

687
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
hoping that, well, the words might
help him somewhere down the road.

688
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The long and winding road?

689
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey, Henry.

690
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You have a great mom and dad,
and they love you tons,

691
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
even though it's weird
they live in different countries.

692
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And I know right now
it feels like you're in a sad song.

693
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But you, young man,

694
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
you have the power to take a sad song
and make it better.

695
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I like that.

696
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah, me too.

697
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This!

698
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Enjoy yourself, laddie!
Come on! Fucking sing it!

699
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You know, Ted,
I'm so curious about something.

700
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why didn't you ever
take Michelle to Paris yourself?

701
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, I wanted to. I mean, you know,
we were too broke to go on our honeymoon.

702
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then, well, we both got busy.

703
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And then we had Henry, and I just...
I always thought we'd have more time.

704
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ted, I'm sorry.

705
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you.

706
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But seriously, who gives a flying fuck
if Michelle gets engaged?

707
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That time in your relationship with her
has passed,

708
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
but your time with Henry hasn't.

709
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You need to stop letting yesterday
get in the way of today, Ted.

710
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, I don't think
he's singing "Yesterday."

711
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ted.

712
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, I know. I'm just joking.

713
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And you're right.

714
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Of course, I'm right. I'm always right.

715
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Now, for the love of God,
will you get back to that pub

716
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and sing "Hey Jude" with your boy?

717
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Mercy buckets, Boss.

718
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
De rien, Coach Lasso.

719
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you.

720
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah. Uh-huh.

721
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, I agree. It's much better.

722
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you, George.

723
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay, so, good news.

724
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We've got a much more toned-down
version of the statement.

725
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The last one was so shit.

726
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Great.

727
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I was once broken up with
by a guy's doorman.

728
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry, Ms. Hobbes,
Jonathan won't be coming down. Ever.

729
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey.

730
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I know it's lame.
But it will help, believe me.

731
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
or something like that.

732
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We tried. It's the fucking Internet.

733
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Making this statement
is taking care of it now.

734
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
By having me make an apology?

735
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

736
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Please just do it.

737
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Sorry, but it's not a great look
when the person I'm seeing,

738
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
whose company I fund, has a porno online.

739
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A porno?

740
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You know what I mean. We're just...
We're limiting the damage. Okay?

741
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Jack, I'm not doing it.

742
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This video being leaked is not my fault.
But for some reason, you think it is.

743
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's certainly not something
to be proud of, Keeley.

744
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't regret making that video.

745
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I don't regret sending it.

746
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Are there more out there?

747
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know.

748
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you doing?

749
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think I should go.

750
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you coming back?

751
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know.

752
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Right.

753
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you want to go out and celebrate?

754
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Celebrate what?

755
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Didn't you win today?

756
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, yeah. But…

757
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No. That's okay though.

758
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Already working on the next one, so…

759
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You should enjoy your victories.

760
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It looks like they did.

761
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There it is.

762
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What?

763
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I love your smile.

764
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah.

765
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If you're into labels.

766
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah. No, I'm into labels. Sure.

767
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah?

768
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah.

769
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
"This is Jade. She's my girlfriend."

770
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah?

771
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Sounds good, doesn't it?

772
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
"Nate. That's my boyfriend."

773
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Nate's your boyfriend?

774
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah. Have you met him? He's amazing.

775
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Thank you very much.

776
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Jamie.

777
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey.

778
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hi.

779
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So, I'm sorry just to drop in on you.
I just...

780
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was nervous to text you. I...

781
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

782
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean, like,
you and everyone in my family.

783
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah.

784
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

785
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, I just... I wanted to check in
on you. See how you're doing.

786
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just so fucking shit, all of this.

787
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thanks, Jamie.

788
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah, doing all right.

789
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah?

790
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's good.

791
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And I also... I just...
I wanted to apologize.

792
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No, you don't have to do that.

793
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No, I do. Oh, no, I do.

794
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I do.

795
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Jamie, this is not your fault.

796
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, it is my fault.
And let me just... I just need to tell you.

797
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I mean, not straightaway,
'cause I did think that you and me

798
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
was maybe gonna get back together again.

799
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But then you started going out with Roy,
and that's when I deleted most of it.

800
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, like, half.

801
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But that was mostly out of anger,
to be honest.

802
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because, well, I think...

803
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I thought the only reason that the two of
you was going out was to make me jealous.

804
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But…

805
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Then I saw it was real,
and then I got rid of it all.

806
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I just forgot about the fucking emails.

807
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's so stupid.
I should have been more careful.

808
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I should have picked
a stronger password or something.

809
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, no.

810
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't tell me your password
was "password," Jamie.

811
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah.

812
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, to be fair, I did think I'd fool 'em
'cause I spelled it with two S's.

813
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Keeley.

814
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Really am.

815
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you, Jamie.

816
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Excuse me, do you mind
taking a photo of me at the box?

817
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, yeah.

818
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Thanks.

819
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All right.

820
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No.

821
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's like that. Yeah.

822
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
All right.

823
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's all right.

824
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Take a good one.

825
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
All right. Smile. There we go.

826
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
All right, big guy. Time to roll.
Let's do it.

827
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Bonjour!

828
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In here!

829
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hi, kiddo.

830
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Mom!

831
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I missed you.
Did you have fun with your dad?

832
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah. He's gonna buy me a drum kit.

833
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Is he really?

834
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
W...

835
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You know what? I love you, buddy.

836
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I love you too, Dad.

837
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
All right, go on. Get outta here.

838
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know where he gets these ideas.

839
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, don't forget this thing.

840
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you doing?

841
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You... Sorry, I was screwing around.

842
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay.

843
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
How was Paris?

844
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was all right.

845
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah. Well, that's what it's known for.
City of all rights.

846
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Come on, Mom!

847
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know, Dave Grohl learned
to play drums on pillows.

848
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm coming!

849
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There he is. Huh?
