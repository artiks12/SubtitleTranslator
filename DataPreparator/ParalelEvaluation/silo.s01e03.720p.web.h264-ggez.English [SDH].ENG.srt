1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Should've known you'd be early.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You look tired already.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I was hoping to meet Juliette Nichols
before you keel over.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We'll see who gets tuckered out.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
After you.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You dead?

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bet you wish you were.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Come on, you're late.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How did you get in here?

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You threw up in the hallway.

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And by the smell of it,
pretty much everywhere.

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Could you talk about something else?

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, you mean something other than vomit?

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You don't want me talking about puking?

16
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Why you wearing that again?

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You gonna tell me what's going on?

18
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're not a drinker, Jules.

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Not a good one, no.

20
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Shit. My fix is failing.

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Water?

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sure.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Here.

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Unless you dumped water to lighten
your load, I think you got a leak.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You wanna say hello to the judge?

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But you do want her goons to be sure
and see you standing here.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey!

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, I... I was just gonna do s...

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No!

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Juliette, how am I supposed to learn...

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No! Enough!

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You wanna tell me what's going on?

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
'Cause I'm at a damn loss.

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You told Cooper to go in.

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Was I supposed to wait for you to show up?

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Really incredible smell, by the way.

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You know my rules.

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Your rules?

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Last I heard, I'm the head of Mechanical,
and you're my shadow.

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Though I can't remember the last time
you actually listened to me.

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Only I go through the hatch.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So you feel okay about decking Coop?

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Jules, he's your shadow.
The kid fucking worships you.

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's my job to make sure it's running.

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And you care so much
that you showed up two hours late.

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're putting off the inevitable.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We have to shut it down
and make a real fix.

49
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Jules, I can't be the first guy
in the history of the Silo

50
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to shut the generator down.

51
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Better it happen on our terms

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
with the backup running
than the rotor shattering...

53
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Even an hour in darkness
will be utter chaos.

54
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Nothing compared to what's gonna happen...

55
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Jules.

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's fucking better it happens
on our terms

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
than the rotor shattering!

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Jules, I'll tell... I'll tell you what.

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll tell you what.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll have this discussion tomorrow
when you're not hungover or still drunk.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go home.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wash off whatever it is I'm smelling
and take your punishment.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You punched Cooper in the face.

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You either gotta do a day
on the trash line

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or work off some tickets with Walker.

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Can't I just let him punch me back?

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was gonna come out
to applaud. Walking the Silo at...

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you say "at your age,"
you don't get what I brought you.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What did you bring me?

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Just a little token of my gratitude
for all we've done together.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, gee,
I'm glad somebody's getting something.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I joined her on this march of death,

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and she hasn't given me anything
but grief.

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You must really want something.

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, I might need a little help
with our friend in the robe.

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Judge Meadows.

77
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Her office messaged me
and said you neglected to stop by.

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you want Paul Billings to be sheriff?

79
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mayor, you know me.
Doesn't matter what I want.

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You just run the numbers.

81
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Which tell me that Paul Billings
is the most favorable candidate.

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is that for the Silo, or is that for IT?

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What did your numbers say about Holston?

84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They said he'd be a great sheriff,
which he was until he wasn't.

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What do they say about Juliette Nichols?

86
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't need her numbers. She's a thief.

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thief?

88
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Her record's clean.

89
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
She stole four boxes of H57 tape
reserved for IT.

90
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
She stole tape.

91
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not just any tape.

92
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Heat tape we use to prevent our servers
from cooking.

93
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And honestly,
the problem isn't what she stole.

94
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's the fact that she stole at all.

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Bernard, she was Holston's pick.

96
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Mayor, you can't seriously consider her.

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Deputy.

98
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Doesn't matter what he thinks.

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm just the escort.

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't like Judicial's choice
being shoved down my throat.

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mayor, bringing me a bottle of brandy

102
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
is not going to help you
win a turf battle with Judge Meadows.

103
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's good brandy.

104
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It could be from the before times
for all I care.

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Here are some other numbers
you should consider.

106
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Every hour the Silo is without a sheriff,

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the probability of catastrophe
increases by one point.

108
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
While we're sitting here chitchatting,
frightened citizens are arming themselves,

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
because they don't know
who's going to protect them.

110
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Billings is a good choice.

111
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just make him sheriff,

112
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and leave walking the Silo to kids
with nothing better to do.

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She's coming.

114
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's coming.

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Couldn't help yourself, could you?

116
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I sent word.

117
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They need us now, Sam.

118
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mayor! Welcome to the Mids.

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Welcome to the Mids, Mayor Jahns!

120
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hi. Hello!

121
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I know it's been a long time
since I crossed this bridge.

122
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're all scared.

123
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We lost a great man and a fine sheriff,
but it's this community.

124
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's the way you love each other
that truly holds the Silo together

125
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
even when times are tough, like now.

126
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We love you, Mayor Jahns.

127
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm voting for you in the next election.
We're all voting for you.

128
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

129
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
but I'm not gonna leave this level
till I see the babies.

130
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is Jacob, Mayor Jahns. - Oh. Lovely. Very good to see you.

131
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is Harry.

132
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Harry was in a hurry.
Came out three weeks early.

133
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As I recall from your last visit,

134
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you like to say hello
to any mothers-to-be.

135
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Actually, Doctor, we were hoping
for a moment with you alone.

136
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We were hoping to talk to you
about your daughter, Juliette.

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is she all right?

138
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She's fine.

139
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She's being considered for a new position.

140
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mmm.

141
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just the standard vetting.

142
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Any questions I can answer?

143
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How come she lives down deep?

144
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You understand it is unusual
for someone born in the Mids

145
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
with a doctor for a father
to end up in Mechanical.

146
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Our troubles started.

147
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It was hard on Jules.

148
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A loss like that...

149
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She showed real interest in machines
from an early age.

150
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Always figuring out how things worked,
how to fix them if they didn't.

151
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think it felt good
to be able to fix something.

152
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How old was she when she left?

153
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thirteen.

154
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When did you last speak to her?

155
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's been a while.

156
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have new babies every week.

157
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Jules has the generator.
It's a long walk down to Mechanical.

158
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't get there and back on my day off.
I need that day to rest.

159
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well. If that's all,
I have an expectant mother in breech,

160
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and I need to get baby turned around.

161
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
More questions than answers.

162
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's so hard to describe.

163
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What you saw or what you felt?

164
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, I felt fine.

165
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

166
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It wasn't the darkness
I was worried about. I, uh...

167
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, I didn't feel scared.

168
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If I was scared, I'd tell you.

169
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

170
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, fuck. Yeah, I felt scared. I, uh...

171
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That much water, it's...

172
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It was just more water
than I've ever seen.

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You know, George, he...

174
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He left me all these clues,
and I couldn't do it.

175
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't go down there.

176
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's what I feel. I feel pissed off.

177
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So pissed off you took it out on Cooper.

178
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't wanna talk about Cooper.

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What do you want?

180
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Run away.

181
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's okay. I get that. I get it.

182
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You know, we scream, we fight, we get mad.

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But every now and then,
we should tell ourselves,

184
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
"We did what we could. We did our best."

185
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
"We." Really? "We"?

186
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't even know why I'm getting advice
from someone who sits at her bench

187
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
every day listening to the radio.

188
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You haven't left the workshop in 20 years.

189
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Did I ever tell you
about the first arrest I made?

190
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was right here in this park,
right over there.

191
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
3:00 a.m. Drunk, naked couple going at it.
That was my first arrest.

192
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You know what my second arrest was?

193
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Twenty-four hours later. Same drunken
couple going at it right there.

194
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's time.

195
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was thinking that maybe I might open up
a stall in the market,

196
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
try to sell my drawings to anybody
blind enough to want 'em.

197
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do.

198
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I always thought Holston
would take over from me.

199
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Compliments of Judge Meadows.
Strawberries fresh from the farm.

200
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you haven't tried this, don't.
One bite can be habit-forming.

201
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is this supposed to intimidate me?

202
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Dessert?

203
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No. I wanted to make sure you...

204
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Anything swimming in
that much sugar is bad for the heart.

205
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then I blew it. It was supposed to be
a friendly gesture and a little nudge.

206
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You didn't stop by to see Judge Meadows.

207
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I didn't know I was supposed to.

208
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mayor, the second Holston went out,

209
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the clock started
on finding his replacement.

210
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Paul Billings is a good choice.

211
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's a family man,
dedicated, hardworking, smart.

212
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He cares about the people.

213
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mr. Sims.

214
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll make my decision
when I've completed my trip.

215
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sam, you want it?

216
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, Rob, I'm good.

217
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Suicide is a serious crime.

218
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, it wasn't suicide.

219
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So you've said.

220
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
"What I was looking for."

221
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fuck. Fuck!

222
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's not good.

223
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No shit. Where's Jules?

224
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Knox.

225
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Madam Mayor. Deputy.

226
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We weren't expecting you...

227
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Everything all right?

228
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah. It's all under control.

229
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do you want us to come back or...

230
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's not supposed to sound
like that, is it?

231
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, ma'am.

232
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What's going on?

233
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The fix is failing again.

234
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, I can see that.

235
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've tried switching...

236
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I need to listen.

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is that her?

238
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

239
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Excuse me, Madam Mayor.

240
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What's going on?

241
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't worry.

242
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Jules!

243
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The vibration's changed.

244
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What?

245
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's shifted. All this time,

246
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
the vibration's been moving it...

247
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This way.

248
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And now it's going that way.

249
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Shit.

250
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So, what do we do?

251
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You leave. Check the output.

252
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, everybody, back.

253
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Back. Come on.

254
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Jules, I c... I can help.

255
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I know this generator
just as much as any...

256
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Coop! You're her shadow.

257
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We can't have you both up here
if this goes sideways.

258
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Close it behind me.
This is what I was warning you about.

259
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I know.

260
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Good luck.

261
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Fuck.

262
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't let her leave.

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hey, Madam Mayor?

264
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll be fine.

265
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If I'd known
I was getting a visit from the mayor,

266
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'd have tidied up.

267
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't tidy up for old friends.

268
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Besides, you knew I was coming.

269
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You heard it on the radio you made.

270
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Which is so prohibited by the Pact,
I don't know where to start.

271
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You up-toppers really don't know
your machines, do you? That's a toaster.

272
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was sad your marriage broke up.

273
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Was 25 years ago.

274
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was still sad.

275
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You and Carla were a good couple.
What happened?

276
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What can I do for you, Ruth?

277
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Juliette Nichols.

278
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What about her?

279
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I need your honest opinion of her.

280
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Who is she, Martha?

281
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Am I under arrest or something?

282
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Should you be?

283
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Juliette.

284
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Uh-huh.

285
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm Mayor Jahns.

286
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Could we have a moment?

287
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sure.

288
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Can't you just stay?

289
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You got this.

290
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One of my duties as mayor
is appointing the next sheriff.

291
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
One of the Silo traditions is that
the outgoing sheriff leaves a suggestion

292
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
as to who should be next to wear the star.
Holston Becker chose you.

293
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry, what?

294
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I must tell you,

295
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
no one wants you for this job.

296
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

297
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Except for one deceased former sheriff
and me.

298
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I know it's a lot to take in.

299
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Pardon?

300
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I... I don't want it.

301
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hallelujah.

302
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
May I ask why?

303
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Everyone thinks their job in the Silo
is the most important. Mine actually is.

304
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The generator, she's not well.

305
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And if I'm not here
to make sure she's running and...

306
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have to take care of her.

307
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, that is too bad.

308
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Holston wanted you to have this...

309
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
whether or not you took the job.

310
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Take care, Juliette.

311
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What the fuck?

312
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Stop cheating.

313
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come on.

314
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wow.

315
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That makes no sense.

316
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You? Sheriff?

317
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

318
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why?

319
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know.

320
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Because you get shit done.

321
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You'd be a great sheriff.

322
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Coop, you don't have to suck up.

323
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She's not gonna hit you again.

324
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It should be you, Hank.

325
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Can I see it?

326
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, sure.

327
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know, Sheriff Holston was the reason
I wanted to become a deputy.

328
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I mean what do I...
What do I know about law enforcement? I...

329
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What did you know about being an engineer?

330
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Not a whole lot.

331
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hey. What's this?

332
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Something's carved
in the back of the badge.

333
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mayor Jahns!

334
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I changed my mind.

335
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll... I'll take the job.

336
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, that's wonderful.

337
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
On one condition.

338
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's a condition?

339
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I need to fix the generator.

340
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

341
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And in order to fix the generator...

342
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
...I need to shut it down.

343
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You need to shut down the generator?
Put us all in the dark?

344
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We've got a backup.

345
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which provides minimal power.

346
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Barely enough for life support.

347
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What you're asking for,
that has never been done.

348
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No. I...

349
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I know.

350
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
People would be terrified.

351
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
People are gonna be terrified when...
When the rotor shatters,

352
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and we're living off the backup
in darkness.

353
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Forever.

354
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can do it.

355
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
In order to repair
the generator,

356
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
an eight-hour power outage
will begin tonight at 10:00 p.m.

357
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The Silo will be completely dark
for that period.

358
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You are ordered to gather
in the designated safe zones

359
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
or to stay at home.
Those failing to comply will be jailed.

360
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's how the rotor
should be spinning, right?

361
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So sometime in the last 30 years,
something damaged it.

362
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

363
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know.

364
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Maybe someone dropped
a tool from the catwalk.

365
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
How much damage?

366
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
All it takes is one tiny dent.

367
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Doesn't matter how many times
we tweak the alignment.

368
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It always moves out of place.

369
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So soon the entire thing is gonna break,

370
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
which means we can't make enough juice
to power up a single level,

371
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
let alone the entire Silo.

372
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So how do we fix it?

373
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
First, we're gonna open it up
and see where it's broken.

374
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then, to fix whatever's wrong, we're
gonna have to shut down the generator.

375
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And did you tell the mayor
we can't actually do that?

376
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sure, we can.

377
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Knox controls the steam flow
from down here.

378
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And if he turns it off,

379
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
how much time do you think
we'll have before it blows up?

380
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know. An hour?

381
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you get half that, you'll be lucky.

382
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Lemme show you why.

383
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We don't know
what we're dealing with here,

384
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
so we've all gotta be ready.
Expect the worst.

385
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Any issues, radio me here,

386
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and I'll coordinate
with the other stations.

387
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Be alert. We don't know what to expect.

388
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Everyone be safe out there.

389
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Molly, you and your team
head out on patrol.

390
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let everyone know you're there.

391
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know what to do. Let's get to it.

392
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hey, if it stays quiet,
there's a cot in holding,

393
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and the sofa in my office pulls out.

394
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wouldn't say either are comfortable.

395
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Good to know.

396
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now, could you escort the mayor
to the hostel, please?

397
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll stay here.

398
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No.

399
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It'll be quiet, but I wanna know
how things are going in the Silo.

400
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
As far as we know,
the Silo's never been on backup power

401
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and you think it'll be quiet?

402
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Tonight they'll just be afraid.

403
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And tomorrow,
if the lights don't come back on?

404
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hope you have the combination
to the gun safe.

405
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The steam comes in from way down deep.
No one knows from where.

406
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All we know is that it comes up
through this pipe,

407
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
makes this bend,
and goes straight up to the turbine.

408
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, the founders were smart.

409
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They knew they couldn't control how the
steam behaved, so they built in a safety.

410
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the containment chamber.

411
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It protects the turbine in case
there's a sudden surge

412
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and someone needs to regulate the flow.

413
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You wanna stop the generator? Knox has
to close this main valve all the way.

414
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That happens, you get about 30 minutes

415
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
before the pressure redlines,
and he needs to release it.

416
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We're gonna need more time.

417
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Can we keep it in the red?

418
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We could if steam was cold,
but it's not because it's steam.

419
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The more pressure it's under,
the hotter it gets.

420
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And that pressure just keeps on building
until... ...it blows.

421
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So, 30 minutes before redline?

422
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
At most.

423
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Boss?

424
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The mayor's authorized
eight hours on backup.

425
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They must weigh...

426
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
1.35 tons. Each.

427
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Guys, there's no part of this that's easy.

428
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The slightest mistake at any point
could get somebody killed,

429
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
or worse,
leave 10,000 people in the dark forever.

430
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Put five of our strongest guys
on each panel.

431
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Once they're open,
I'll slow the generator down to 50%,

432
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
but I won't stop it. Not yet.

433
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We'll identify the problem.

434
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Then Jules will signal to me
when she's ready.

435
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Our 30 minutes starts right then.
All right?

436
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yep.

437
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Now, Jules,
who do you want up there with you?

438
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
All right. Let's get to it! Come on!

439
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right. Stay off the stairs.

440
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Stay off the s... Back inside, please, sir.
Ma'am, ma'am... Thank you.

441
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go ahead.

442
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Switching to backup.

443
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Backup's holding steady.

444
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Cutting steam to 50%.

445
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go ahead and start on the panels.

446
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's incredible.

447
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

448
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's where I gotta go.

449
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey! You okay?

450
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When we get up there,
we're gonna tuck ourselves in.

451
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We're gonna fix what we can.

452
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Anything larger, we're gonna send
down for them to fix. Okay?

453
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

454
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah?

455
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay.

456
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Jules!

457
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yep?

458
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You give me the word.

459
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
All right.

460
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Go ahead.

461
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Closing hatch. Our 30 minutes start now.

462
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Stop! We're here.

463
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay!

464
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Shit. Oh, it's bad.

465
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay. This blade is the problem.
We're gonna send it down.

466
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We'll fix the rest up here.
Get the equipment up.

467
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Teddy, bring it up!

468
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Coop, I need you on the other side!

469
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Coop, I need you to check on that.

470
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay, guys. It's going up now!

471
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

472
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You know how I say doing things right
is better than doing them fast?

473
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Right now, I need both.

474
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Where the fuck is my tool?

475
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay, ready? Pull.

476
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Uh-huh.

477
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Pull.

478
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yep. Got it.

479
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Send it down.
I need to fix the smaller blades.

480
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We're ready!

481
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey! You got it?

482
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Uh-huh.

483
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Look out!

484
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Look out! Heads up!

485
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, my God. No!

486
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You guys okay?

487
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah!

488
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Then pick the damn thing up and get it
straight so Jules can get it back in.

489
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey, Cooper! Cooper, focus!
I need you on the bolts. Come on. Now!

490
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Go! Let's do it! Come on, boys.

491
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, Cooper!

492
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Temperature holding.

493
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Daddy!

494
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Daddy!

495
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Daddy!

496
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's okay, Son.

497
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's too dark.

498
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's okay.

499
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't worry.

500
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The dark's nothing to be afraid of, okay?

501
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Daddy's gonna stay here with you
till you fall asleep.

502
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is LaFontaine on 80.

503
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All quiet up to the farms.

504
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Copy that.

505
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't sleep.

506
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then don't.

507
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ten thousand people
aren't sleeping right now,

508
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
terrified the power won't come back.

509
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Afraid maybe the groundwater will rise,
and they'll drown.

510
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Or maybe a bunch of nutjobs will bust out
through the top and let the poison in.

511
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We've always been
one catastrophic failure away

512
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
from the end of it all,

513
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and this just makes everyone
conscious of it.

514
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Maybe that's not a bad thing.

515
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Makes you appreciate the day you have.

516
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know you think
appointing Nichols is a mistake,

517
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
but something about her makes me hopeful.

518
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hopeful enough, I might be able
to hand the reins over to someone else.

519
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You'd consider retiring?

520
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
To do what? Sit around and knit?

521
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why not?

522
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Maybe open a shop

523
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
right next to some guy who does drawings.

524
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You know I didn't come all this way
just to meet Nichols.

525
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I wanted to spend time with you.

526
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I know it's why I came.

527
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Fuck! Boss! Boss!

528
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's overheating
way faster than we thought.

529
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How much time?

530
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
A few minutes, maybe?

531
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Jules, you gotta get out!

532
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We only got a few minutes! Jules!

533
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What? What did he say?

534
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We only have a few minutes.

535
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What? No.

536
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No, Knox. We need more time!

537
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We're redlining!

538
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Already?

539
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The temperature's higher than we expected!
I gotta open the valve!

540
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No! Not without the rotor blade! Fuck.

541
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Teddy! Teddy!

542
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're trying!

543
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Try harder!

544
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
How's it looking?

545
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's getting worse.

546
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Fuck.

547
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Fuck.

548
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay. Take over.

549
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Keep working, okay?

550
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's just like I taught you, okay?

551
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All right.

552
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When the blade comes up,
you get it in there, you bolt it in place.

553
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Make sure to get the angle right
or we're screwed.

554
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But I can't do this with... - No, no, no. Look at me.

555
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're ready. You can do it, okay?

556
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Teddy!

557
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Another minute!

558
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He needs it now!

559
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Get it up there!

560
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm trying!

561
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Jules, where are you going?

562
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Gonna try and buy us more time!

563
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Shit!

564
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I got it in here. You go make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

565
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Jules? What are you doing?

566
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's the only way to cool it down.

567
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When I yell, turn it on.

568
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're going in there?

569
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Now! Turn it on!

570
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We're cooling down.
Fuck yes, Jules! It's working.

571
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. You crazy bitch.

572
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Uh, stay inside, please, sir.

573
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Thank you.

574
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Help! Somebody, help!

575
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Help! Help!

576
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Somebody, help! Help!

577
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I was trying to get home,
and the lights went out.

578
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's okay, sir. We got you now. Here.
Beson'll get you back safe.

579
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Teddy, the blade!

580
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Another minute!

581
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Shit, shit.

582
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Come on. Come on, Jules.

583
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Just give me a few more minutes. Come on.

584
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Come on!

585
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Boss! Knox!

586
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Teddy, hurry the fuck up!

587
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Nearly there!

588
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Coming in.

589
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Faster! We're redlining again!

590
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Get it up!

591
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Jules!
The blade's goin' up to Coop!

592
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Stop, stop! I got it!

593
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hurry!

594
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Knox!

595
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Fuck.

596
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Cooper!
Get that blade on! It's gonna blow!

597
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Come on, Coop!
You gotta get it up there!

598
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Shirley! Come on!

599
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Fuck! She's still in there!

600
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We need to get her out! Fuck!

601
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come on!

602
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Come on!

603
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Come on! Help!

604
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Come on, Jules.
Just give me a few more seconds.

605
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Cooper! Get the fuck out now!

606
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm almost there!

607
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Come on.

608
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Done!

609
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Get him down! Get Jules out now!

610
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Come on!

611
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Fuck.

612
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Go! Get her out!

613
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Grab it! Pull!

614
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Jules?

615
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Come on!

616
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Come on!

617
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Fuck.

618
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She's out! Chamber is clear!

619
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Did they get it done?

620
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, maybe... I think so.

621
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come on.

622
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hope you're not expecting me
to praise you for doing your job.

623
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I came to say I'm sorry for what I said.

624
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You weren't wrong.
I haven't left this place in a long time.

625
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, but I failed,
and I... I took it out on you.

626
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How did you fail?

627
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I tried to do what George wanted me to,
and I... I couldn't.

628
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, when I first
heard about you and the computer guy,

629
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I... I didn't know what to think.

630
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then Shirley told me
he made you smile.

631
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah.

632
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry you didn't get to meet him.

633
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, it's all right. I told him not to.

634
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I sent for him. I said I had a problem
with my computer,

635
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
which I didn't 'cause I built it.

636
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
When he got here, I told him if he did
anything to hurt you,

637
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
he would vanish without a trace.

638
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
To take up a job you're
clearly unqualified to do.

639
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wow. I've always enjoyed
your words of encouragement.

640
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What is that?

641
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know.
I found it with George's stuff.

642
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You brought a relic into my workshop?

643
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You love finding out how things work.

644
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I also like not dying.

645
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They wouldn't send you out to clean.

646
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The only way you'll get out of this place
is feet first.

647
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Thanks.

648
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Anyway, if you get a minute,
can you try and figure out what it is?

649
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sure.

650
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thanks.

651
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

652
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for everything.

653
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Mm-hmm.

654
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll send messages.

655
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sheriff gets a radio. I'll be listening.

656
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, of course you will.

657
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
One more thing.

658
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't end up like George.

659
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mayor Jahns,

660
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
please tell me why this Silo
spent last night in the dark.

661
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Because it was night.

662
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's helpful, Deputy. Thank you.

663
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It was crucial we fix the generator.
I made the call.

664
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You made a deal with Juliette Nichols,
our soon-to-be sheriff?

665
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How did you hear that, Bernard?

666
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
She's a thief from Mechanical.

667
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
She'll be great.

668
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Ten thousand lives, Ruth.

669
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And all the generations that follow that.

670
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I pray to the Founders you're right.

671
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's strange. I haven't left Mechanical
since I got here.

672
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It is time. There's some stuff
you gotta face up there.

673
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And when you get sick of the up-toppers,
get your ass back down here.

674
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We'll be waiting for a visit
from our sheriff.

675
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Come on.

676
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're gonna be great.

677
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah. Okay.

678
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Go.

679
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What about finding out the truth?

680
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
When I find something, I will, uh...
I'll send word.

681
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A signal.

682
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I promise.

683
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I hope you're not making
a horrible mistake.

684
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you all right? Yeah?

685
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mmm. I'm fine.

686
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You sure?

687
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why don't you grab a bottle of wine
and take me back to my apartment?

688
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Which one?

690
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Whatever you want.

691
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, Ruth, you think one bottle's enough?

692
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Maybe I get two, huh?

693
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We...

694
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ruth.

695
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ruth?

696
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Ruth!

697
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ruth.

698
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ruth.

699
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ruth. Ruth!

700
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ruth!

701
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ruth.

702
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ruth. Oh, no.

703
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Help!

704
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Somebody, please!

705
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Somebo... Somebody! Somebody!
