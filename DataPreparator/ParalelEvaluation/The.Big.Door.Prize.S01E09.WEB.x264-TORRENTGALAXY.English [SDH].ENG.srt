1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, Mr. Johnson. Are you still open?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're the kid that tried to crack open
the machine with a screwdriver.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, I'm Xander.
I didn't know if you'd remember me.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I bought it off Giorgio,

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
thinking I could maybe use it
to saw people in half, but, um...

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sorry. I wanted to come, but I was working.

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, you didn't miss much.
Most of my tricks didn't work.

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm starting to think
I might not be a magician after all.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Maybe this will cheer you up.

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The antenna was busted when I found it,

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but I figured out how to fix it.

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You know what I used?

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Gum.

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You thought this would cheer me up?

16
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, I thought you might want it,
to go with the other one.

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The other what?

18
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The other machine.

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are you thinking about?

20
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you thinking about
how your mother betrayed you

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and tried to turn the whole town
against you?

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah.

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, that's what I thought
you might be thinking about.

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you thinking about?

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm thinking about that too, yeah.

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And just feeling utterly enraged
on your behalf.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Uh, see, I think after this,
I'm gonna have to cut your mother off.

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Not have her around for dinner
or talk to her at all anymore, maybe.

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You'd do that for me?

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've also been thinking about
this minor revelation that I had tonight.

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
it was like something shifted inside me.

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So? What does that mean?

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You wanna go back to Whistler?

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No. I don't know what it means.

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What did it mean to you
when you got "Royalty"?

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You wanna ask me now?

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I am. I'm asking you now,

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which I know is very late,
but I do wanna know.

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think I just felt like
I had some value or something.

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You didn't feel like you had any value?

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
N-No. No, I did.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Something shifted in me too,

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I felt like maybe it was okay
to wanna be...

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
seen.

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's... That's pathetic, but...

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No. No, that's not pathetic.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's not. Hey, you wanna talk pathetic?
Let's talk about Giorgio, huh?

49
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Swanning around in his big wig
like a porno John Travolta,

50
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
stuffing God-knows-what
down his underpants.

51
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wait. Giorgio wears a wig?

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes! I've been dying to tell you...

53
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
...but so much other stuff
has been happening.

54
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just, um, FYI, I still sleep next door.
You guys literally couldn't be any louder.

55
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sorry, sweetie. We'll shut up.

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah,
we were just talking revelations, honey.

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Is your revelation that it's 2:00 a.m.?

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No, no. No, I was just saying to your mom

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that maybe everything is
not quite as it seems.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You know what? Yeah, I changed my mind.
I'm actually glad you woke me up for this.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, no, no. Listen, listen.
What I'm saying is,

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
what if "Teacher/Whistler"
doesn't really mean "Teacher/Whistler"?

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just like "Royalty"
doesn't literally mean "Royalty."

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Maybe "Potter"
doesn't literally mean "Potter."

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I didn't get "Potter." I got "Liar,"
which I'm assuming had to do with the fact

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that I was cheating on Kolton
with his twin brother before he died

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and lying to him about it
and lying to everyone about it,

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and I've been seeing Jacob and lying
to everyone about that ever since.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But if you have a different interpretation
of what "Liar" could mean,

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I would love to hear it.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I would have to have a think about that.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mmm.

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, my God.

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Why are you sorry?

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because...

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry that you felt like you couldn't
come and talk to us about this.

77
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I just feel like, "Oh, fuck. We really...
We really dropped the ball on this."

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You know,
I don't know if now is the right time,

79
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but I've... I've always thought that Jacob
was a better fit for you, as it happens.

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I... I'd say that now...
Now's not the right time to say that.

81
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
while fixing my gaze with a roguish smile.

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I took another sip of my ashwagandha tea
as I waited for her to continue.

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
"Apparently," she sputtered,
"the silent majority of MORPHO Mistrusters

84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
has called for a return to normalcy..."

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nobody is calling for that.

86
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
"...which is why she feels
she has no other choice

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but to continue on as mayor

88
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and proceed with preparations
for this year's Deerfest.

89
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Natalie Pearl, Deerfield Digest."

90
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
...I would rather eat Giorgio's wig
than attend this year's Deerfest.

91
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And you can print that as my response.

92
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, I don't know if you're joking,
but if Giorgio has a wig,

93
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will print that
because that's a huge story.

94
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And secondly, yes,
you will go to Deerfest. We always go.

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and I refuse
to let Izzy rub that in my face.

96
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Most people still believe in the machine,
and they know

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I heard that you're giving people
money back for their sweatshirts.

98
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, Sheila.
Anything that is MORPHO-related

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that people wanna give back, they...

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Whoa. Are you taking that off right now?

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ooh.

102
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Do you have something on under there?

103
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No.

104
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, what is the play here?

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Also, I don't think
that's one of your sweatshirts.

106
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The letters are all wrong,
and they're peeling.

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, and I don't even think
you got "Rockstar," Sheila.

108
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You were painting rocks
way before the machine arrived.

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, Sheila,
let my friends enjoy their dinner.

110
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Uh... Sheila! What the...

111
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Bye, Sheila.

112
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can I take the opportunity,
with all of you here,

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
just to say sorry again

114
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
about trying to win Cass's heart
and break up your famiglia?

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, you can.

116
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We've talked about it.

117
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wait a minute. What happened?

118
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was in a really weird place.

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, you were on a gondola
trying to fuck my mom.

120
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I think I'm finally almost ready
to open my heart up to new adventures.

121
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's not as conclusive
as I'd like it to be.

122
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've been getting a lot of guidance
from someone

123
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
that I would love
for you to meet, actually.

124
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Cary. Cary, get over here.

125
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Buona sera, everyone.

126
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Grandpa!

127
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello, Dad.

128
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I almost forgot Cary's also your dad.

129
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Did you?

130
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ever since we collabed on that video
for Cass's fundraiser,

131
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been having Care Bear over here
model some of my merch

132
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
with his insanely jacked body.

133
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ah, Giorgio, come on.
I'm not insanely jacked.

134
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I just move a little weight around,
that's all.

135
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Nah, you've been moving me
with your wisdom of life, Mr. C.

136
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's not his name.

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I guess you could say that Big C
has become a bit of a male model for me

138
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
in my life in more ways than one.

139
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Male model? Dad,
that's kind of like you and "Whistler."

140
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
See? Like, they mean different things.

141
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mmm.

142
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay. So, what pearls of wisdom
have you shared with our Giorgio, Dad?

143
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Face your fear.
Don't dwell in the "what-ifs."

144
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You know, "What if people laugh at me
for trying to be a male model at my age?"

145
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
"What if I lose my accounting firm?"

146
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or, "What if my wife meets another man
in Europe and never comes back?"

147
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah. You gotta face your fear.

148
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Otherwise, you'll never know
what's on the other side of it.

149
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Good morning, Deerfield Hooves.

150
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is Axel the "Meteorologist"
with your daily weather report.

151
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know some of you
might not pay attention to this,

152
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
depending on how you feel about
the whole MORPHO controversy.

153
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But for those of you who do,

154
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
there's a cold front
coming in from the northwest.

155
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
High pressure mixing with warm winds
from the east means a storm's coming.

156
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A serious storm,

157
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
which could really put a damper
on the opening of Deerfest tonight,

158
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
so make sure you pack your umbrellas.
Make...

159
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What are you doing?

160
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Jacob and I are dating.

161
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We've been dating for a really long time,
even before Kolton died and ever since.

162
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I mean, we did break up for a bit,
and now we're back together.

163
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But the point is that we're dating,
and we don't wanna keep it a secret.

164
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What the hell is going on in here?
You just can't jump on the PA!

165
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know, and I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to do something really brave.

166
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is Trina, by the way. Trina Hubbard.

167
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I probably should've said that before,
and it's okay if you all hate me now.

168
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Although, I'd really be much happier
if you didn't hate Jacob

169
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
because he's a very good boy.

170
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the only person
we really owe an apology to is Kolton,

171
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but he's not here,

172
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
which means he can't hate us

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and hate us less over time
and then forgive us, hopefully,

174
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
which really fucking sucks,

175
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because I don't want to be a "Liar"
forever.

176
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Also, there is a meeting
of the junior jazz band after school

177
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
in Room 206.

178
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
According to this piece of paper,
they are performing at Deerfest tonight

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in the arts-and-crafts tent,
so check 'em out.

180
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You should've said something.
You knew that I liked you.

181
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And you made me feel like
there was something wrong with me.

182
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, because this is about you, Savannah.

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She's such a skanky little bitch.

184
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey, maybe you're the skanky little bia...

185
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That was a mistake, and that's okay.
We are allowed to make mistakes.

186
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Trina and Jacob just made a mistake,
and they are owning that mistake, so...

187
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She's owning it.

188
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sorry?

189
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thanks for the heads-up.

190
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It would have been really awesome
to have talked about this earlier.

191
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We did talk about it.

192
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We agreed
that it sucked not being together.

193
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
First you told me not to say anything.
Then you went and told my dad first.

194
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then you told your parents.
Now you've told the entire school.

195
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it's just... It's always on your terms,
and I have no part in it at all.

196
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's not true.

197
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He was my brother, you know.

198
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know that.

199
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry. You told Jacob's dad first?

200
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I didn't mean to.

201
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It just kind of came out

202
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that night that you and Mom were
at the cruise thing having your threesome.

203
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, uh... We were
on a normal, romantic, marital getaway

204
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I told you
it would spice up your marriage.

205
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You use the coupon?

206
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Course I used the coupon.

207
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But I don't think any of that is
appropriate in front of the students.

208
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, your daughter started this.

209
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And, Jacob, it feels like we had bonded,
you know?

210
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Could've mentioned it then when we were...

211
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Smoking weed?

212
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When we were talking about relationships
at the store that time,

213
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
which I now realize was me
giving you advice

214
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
about how to get with my own daughter.

215
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You were smoking weed with a student?

216
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's called being human.

217
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We need to make mistakes,
especially when we're young.

218
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not just saying this.
This isn't a lecture.

219
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If there was one thing
that I could say to you as your dad,

220
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and to all of you as your "Teacher,"
it would be this:

221
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
don't be afraid to make mistakes.

222
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Look at all the fully-grown people
out there who have suddenly,

223
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
because of a machine,

224
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
decided that they don't like what they do
for a living,

225
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
or they don't like their garage
or their partner or themselves.

226
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You know what?
I wish I had made more mistakes.

227
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wish I'd taken bigger swings.

228
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know what the MORPHO means,

229
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but I do know
that it has made a lot of people realize

230
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
that they want change
and that they can still change.

231
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And once you see the potential of that,
there's no going back.

232
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, I know I don't wanna go back.

233
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I mean, I wouldn't get much trade-in value
on my Harley,

234
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
especially after the accident.

235
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I don't wanna think I wasn't meant
to be with Farid.

236
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I have a neighbor

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
who's been practicing the bow and arrow
for a month,

238
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and she shot an arrow clean
through her husband's shoulder.

239
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Whoa.

240
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mmm, she all right.

241
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But now she doesn't know if it means
her potential isn't really "Archer,"

242
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
or if she's just in her head about it.

243
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's it.

244
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's it! Yes, sir!

245
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, my God.

246
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, that's so clear now.

247
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is everything okay in here?

248
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, he's just having another revelation.

249
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've been trying to think of the word
for it, and that's it.

250
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The thing that's written on the card,
your "life potential."

251
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's not the job you're meant to have,

252
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
or the destiny, or your goals,
or whatever.

253
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not the end of the road.
It's a turn. It's an arrow.

254
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a thing you need to be told
about yourself

255
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
to point you in the right direction.

256
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sweetheart, you needed to be told
that you could be a "Liar"

257
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in order to tell the truth.

258
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And Jacob, who is filled
with this constant anxiety

259
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because he thinks he can't live up
to the reputation of his "Hero" brother,

260
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is then given a card
that says he, too, can be a "Hero,"

261
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and he has to confront that.

262
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And Axel,
you got "Meteorologist" in order to...

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know. Maybe it was just
to help you believe in yourself,

264
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
which is exactly what your mom said

265
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
on the first night
that we ever talked about this.

266
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Or maybe you're gonna be really good
at predicting storms. I don't know.

267
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But what I do know is that we have been
asking the wrong questions.

268
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We've been asking
where the MORPHO came from,

269
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and what's inside it,
and how does it work.

270
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But what we should have been asking is,
"What's inside of us? How do we work?

271
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And why, of all places in this big world,

272
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
did the MORPHO machine come
to fucking Deerfield?"

273
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's what I wanna know.

274
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm proud of you.

275
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have not even started this lesson.
Do you mind?

276
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay. You got that.

277
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
For a guy who knows jack shit
about basketball

279
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and is a mediocre boxer at best,

280
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
it sounds like
Dusty's not a terrible teacher.

281
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He made some interesting points.

282
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Did he actually say the thing
about people changing their garages?

283
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because that feels like
it was directed at me specifically.

284
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, it definitely was.

285
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, I don't care.

286
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I like this saloon.

287
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I like it too.

288
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Really?

289
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

290
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
For a while, I thought nothing
would ever make you happy again.

291
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Also, I like how you can close the door

292
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and kind of imagine
that you're somewhere else.

293
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We can go somewhere else if you want.
Have you thought of that?

294
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What, like running away?

295
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I know that's kinda the opposite
of Dusty's thing

296
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
about owning your mistakes,

297
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
but I also know things
can really stick to you in a small town.

298
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I threw up once on a ninth-grade
field trip to the botanical gardens,

299
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and people have called me
"Barfy Beau" for 20 years.

300
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've never heard anyone call you that.

301
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And now they'll probably call me
"sad cowboy" or some shit.

302
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And they'll call you "the twin brother
of the dead basketball star

303
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who cheated with his girlfriend,"
or I don't know.

304
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They'll come up with something catchier
and more hurtful, probably.

305
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's run away.
Let's light out for the territories.

306
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah?

307
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, absolutely.

308
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, you got it.

309
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What do we need?
The throat roaster, obviously.

310
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Obviously, yeah.

311
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And the chainsaw.

312
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In what scenario
would we need to take the chainsaw?

313
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In what scenario
would we not take the chainsaw?

314
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know,

315
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I didn't realize that Trina told me
before she told anyone else.

316
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's pretty cool.

317
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I mean, not cool, but ballsy.

318
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That girl's got a real pair of nuts
on her, doesn't she?

319
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah. She does.

320
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hmm, I don't know why you're doing this.
Is this, like,

321
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
a "thank you for being an absent,
shitty mother" present?

322
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, it's just... just a little thing.

323
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's, like, zero chance

324
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that this won't make me feel worse
about myself.

325
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Open it.

326
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Look at that. It's a pretty vase.
It's so beautiful.

327
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Did you make this?

328
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

329
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And it's actually more of a chalice.

330
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh.

331
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Kind of like
what a queen would drink out of.

332
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All right. That's cool.
And yeah, I was right.

333
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's also 99% sure to fall apart
at any second, so...

334
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Cool. Same.

335
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When did you make this?

336
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know.

337
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Kinda just whenever I have the time
to take my mind off of things.

338
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Trina, sweetie, I know
that I have not been paying attention

339
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to everything
that you've been going through lately.

340
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I was at the magic show
and at Giorgio's before with Grizzy,

341
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and I saw what she did to you.

342
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your mom is way more fucked up
than my mom.

343
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't worry. I'll get it!

344
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Geez Louise.

345
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Eat chainsaw, asshole!

346
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Whoa! For God's sake.

347
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, I'm here to murder you,

348
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
because your daughter hooked up
with both my sons!

349
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay. Jesus. Okay, chill. Chill.

350
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm really sorry.
I told him I was coming here.

351
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And he said he had a "killer joke idea,"
which I guess is what that was.

352
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Did you see that, Jacob? His face.

353
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, I saw his face, Dad.

354
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it okay if I...

355
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No, it's fine.

357
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry I called you an asshole.

358
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, I know, it was really funny.

359
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey.

360
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey. What's up?

361
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Cool.

362
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Like, on a date.
Like, yeah... Like a first date.

363
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You know that Cass and I's first date,
we went to Deerfest.

364
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Dusty...

365
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

366
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We can talk about it a different time.
Go on.

367
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, I was just thinking,
now that everyone knows everything,

368
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
we could...

369
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you first.

370
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, it's okay.

371
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm-I'm... I'm glad you had the courage
to go and do that.

372
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And now maybe we can, like,
try to get to know each other

373
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and see if we actually like each other.

374
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Again, maybe not the time,
but I've always thought that you two...

375
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Dad.

376
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Dusty.

377
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, do you wanna go to Deerfest?

378
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Can my parents come?

379
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Trina with the jokes.

380
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, I'm not joking.

381
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's like...
We used to go together all the time,

382
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and, I don't know, I just kinda want
something normal right now.

383
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Going to a deer-themed festival
on your first date with your parents?

384
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I know you don't wanna go.

385
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Grizzy will be there,
and it's, like, a whole thing...

386
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, no. I'll go. Um, I'll go.
I don't care if she's there.

387
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And people are definitely
gonna give you looks

388
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
because of the fake card thing.

389
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mmm.

390
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, I think we're gonna get more looks.

391
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Fair.

392
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So...

393
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, we're gonna get a lot of looks.

394
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I am okay with that, seriously,
if that's what you wanna do.

395
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right, Beau.

396
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Baby girl wants to go to Deerfest,
so wanna go to Deerfest?

397
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Does this answer your question?

398
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's not funny!

399
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah!

400
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Not in the house!

401
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh. Sorry.

402
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Not in the house, Beau!

403
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Sorry!

404
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
but maybe you've noticed
we're about to open Deerfest,

405
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and I'm just curious about
when you plan to finish the hay maze?

406
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It is finished.

407
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, is it?

408
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then why can I see
right over the hay bales?

409
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It needs to be twice as high as this.

410
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's for kids.

411
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And you assume a child
won't appreciate a challenge.

412
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Excuse me, Mayor Fontaine?

413
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Can't you see I'm busy?

414
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know there's a storm coming?

415
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I know there's a storm forecasted.

416
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why do you think we have ponchos?

417
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I suppose you'd be happier
if everybody just stayed home.

418
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I think I would.

419
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If there's lightning,
the hay bales will go up like a torch.

420
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What qualifications do you have
to make this assessment?

421
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Well, I did get a card that said
"Sole Survivor" from the MORPHO machine.

422
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's my first time being out the house
in a month.

423
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I'm still a bit nervous
about things I could survive.

424
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Honey, please.

425
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't know the first thing
about survival.

426
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What was that? Sounded like thunder.

427
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It was probably just one of the rides.

428
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Trina, if you get scared,
you know that you can hold Daddy's hand.

429
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Or we can link arms...

430
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
God.

431
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
...like The Wizard of Oz.

432
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes! Yes.

433
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey, Father Reuben! Deerfest is that way!

434
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, I told Father Reuben
about my whole, uh, arrow theory.

435
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He was very impressed.

436
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Seems the teacher
has become the "Teacher."

437
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, I've been thinking about that
a lot actually.

438
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mmm, it's pretty good, right?

439
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

440
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What?

441
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Nothing.

442
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What?

443
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, I...

444
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I guess I'm just wondering if...

445
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
...then what if we don't turn together?

446
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How do you mean?

447
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What if our arrows don't point
in the same direction?

448
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know.

449
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hello?

450
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hana.

451
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What you doing?

452
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Just trying to fix this hole in the roof
before the big storm comes.

453
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So, you've been listening
to Axel's weather reports, huh?

454
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Um, I don't know who Axel is,
but I've been listening to the news.

455
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What do you normally do when it rains?

456
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I have an elaborate system
called a bucket.

457
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I don't think it's gonna cut it
for this one,

458
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and I don't wanna wake up
in six feet of water, so...

459
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Wait, what do you mean "wake up"?

460
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, this is my room.

461
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I didn't realize you slept here.

462
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It looks more like the room
of a small child who died 80 years ago.

463
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thanks.
That's the aesthetic I was going for.

464
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Where's all your things?

465
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I like to travel light.

466
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Actually got rid of a bunch of stuff
right when I got here.

467
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why did you come here?

468
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you mean?

469
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I came because there was an opening
at the high school for a chaplain.

470
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Same. But I guess you got it.

471
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hana, I'm serious. I wanna know.

472
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why did you come here now?

473
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you doing here, Father?

474
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't wanna be a priest anymore.

475
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, this could be a problem.

476
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Abracadabra.

477
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Johnson?

478
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr. Johnson!

479
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, shoot.
