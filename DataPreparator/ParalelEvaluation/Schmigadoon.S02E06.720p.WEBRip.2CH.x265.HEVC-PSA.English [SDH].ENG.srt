1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And you just need to sign here,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
and here, and here.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Not that it makes a difference,
but what is it that I'm signing?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in case you fail to provide my client
with a suitable male heir.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Suitable?

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No femmes or fatties.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is insane.

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you okay with this?

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Kratt is a murderer.
He's holding Josh hostage.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now, you listen to me, young lady--

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And just to be clear,
we're basically the same age.

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When I became a lawyer, I took an oath.

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
An oath called attorney-client privilege.

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Which means if someone gives me money,

15
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
whatever they've done
or may do one day doesn't matter.

16
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Bobby, how's it coming?

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
All good, Mr. Kratt.
Everything's signed and legally binding.

18
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wonderful.
You know how I feel about the law.

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That it exists to protect you
and only you.

20
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Exactly.

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you, Bobby. You are free to leave.

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ten dollars?

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Girl, be corrupt but have some pride.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello, my sweet. How are you?

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Honestly, not great.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Wedding day jitters.

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Don't worry. That dress will look
much better when you're standing up.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Where is Josh? If you hurt him--

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mr. Skinner will remain unharmed

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
as long as you do
everything you've been asked to do.

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Once we're pronounced man and wife,
he will be released, and then...

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, don't you dare sing to me, you sicko!

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I shut down a dream ballet!
I will shut down this!

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Stop the music! Stop!

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But unfortunately, that someone isn't me.

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My heart belongs to Josh,
and it always will,

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and there's nothing you can do
to change that.

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The wedding is in one hour.
See you at the altar.

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Frau.

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Maybe I was once,
but that was a long time ago.

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I did what I had to do to survive.

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I recommend you do the same.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mr. Kratt is the wealthiest man
in Schmicago.

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You will be comfortable, taken care of.

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And in a place like this,
that's not nothing.

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, you see... ...we actually didn't even want to be here.

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We were just trying
to get back to Schmigadoon.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's kind of funny
when you think about it.

49
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You enjoyed your freedom while you had it.

50
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now it's time you pay your dues
like the rest of us.

51
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like the rest of you?

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Guys like you are lucky.

53
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You and your hippie friends,
you get to live however you like

54
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
while slobs like me
get stuck doing all the work.

55
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's stopping you
from living the life you want?

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello. Uncle Octavius.

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There's been a slight change of plans.

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
After the wedding,
you need to kill Mr. Skinner.

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But I thought the plan was to release him.

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Plans change.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You need to kill him.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It will make it easier
for my new bride to move on.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay. But if I do, will I finally get
my own act at the club like you promised?

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I-I don't know
if you saw my latest proposal, but--

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Kill him.

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What was that about?

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wrong number.

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You literally said, "Uncle Octavius."

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So now you're just going to kill me?

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sure you've got things in your job
you don't like.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't do this.

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not worth it.

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Uncle Octavius will make it worth it.

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How do you know?

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because he's been promising me
for the past 36 years. That's how.

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
S-- Have you ever heard of
the Parable of the Faithful Servant?

77
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The what?

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Mmm.

79
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There once was a faithful servant

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
who served a cruel master.

81
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The master kept asking the servant
to do things for him

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that the servant knew in his heart
w-were wrong.

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But he did them
because he had been promised

84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that he would inherit all of
his master's riches when he died.

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But when the master finally died,
the servant discovered

86
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that he left everything to his new
totally age-inappropriate wife.

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And the servant ended up with nothing
but his own broken dreams.

88
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The end.

89
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I see what you're trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.

90
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Besides, it's too late for me.

91
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's never too late
to follow your dreams, man.

92
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Have you heard the parable of
the guy who helped the other guy,

93
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and it worked out for both of them?

94
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Fill up those tummies.

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I need an orphan! Now!

96
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But the plan.

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The plan failed.

98
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That devil Kratt
has eluded my grasp once again.

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mercy, what happened?

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What happened? He's alive.

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My Daisy's dead.

102
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My blade requires blood.

103
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, who wants to go first?

104
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now, now. Let's not get hasty here.

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's wait until--

106
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No more waiting!

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You claim to be devoted to me,
Miss Codwell.

108
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, now's the time to prove it.

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
God, that was good.

110
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come with me.

111
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Nap time! Everybody needs a nap! Now!

112
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do as you're told.

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you want?

114
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is everything okay?

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We heard screaming.

116
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Did that man harm you?

117
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you in danger?

118
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why'd you call him daddy?

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, I'm fine. We're fine.

120
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Go back to your rooms.
No one's in any danger.

121
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Actually, that's not quite true, my sweet.

122
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Last night, I saw Mr. Skinner
being taken at gunpoint

123
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
by that crooked policeman, Rivera.

124
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How can we help him?
We don't even know where he is.

125
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The same place Rivera took me
20 years ago for questioning.

126
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The basement of Kratt's power plant.

127
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You may get to kill someone yet.

128
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, if providence is kind.

129
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That was amazing.

130
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's so nice for once to get to be
the student instead of the teacher.

131
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you think there's even more
for me to learn about lovemaking?

132
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, definitely.

133
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It was great.

134
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But, you know, even--
even Picasso kept taking lessons.

135
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, there's always,
uh, more to learn.

136
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go away!

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come on.

138
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well. At least you're still getting naked.

139
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you want?

140
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Shouldn't you be out
following your new chosen leader, Josh?

141
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Josh is in trouble.

142
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sergeant Rivera took him
to the power plant

143
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
so they can force Melissa to marry Kratt.

144
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We obviously don't care about Melissa...

145
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

146
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
...but we didn't know what to do,
so we came to you.

147
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's true Josh hurt me.

148
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But sometimes, when your face
has been slapped,

149
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you need to turn the other cheek
and let that person slap you again.

150
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But do you?

151
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, that sounds bad.

152
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, not the best example, darling.

153
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh.

154
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But no matter what he did,
Josh is still our chum.

155
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And if he needs our help, then we need to
be there for him no matter what.

156
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You better gas up the happiness bus.
It's on.

157
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes!

158
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's roll.

159
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And not only did Sloth set Chunk free
and get revenge on his evil family,

160
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
but he became friends with all the Goonies
and shared in their bounteous fortune.

161
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The end.

162
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Good.

163
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Start one more parable
and I'll kill you right now.

164
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, you won't.

165
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let Josh go now.

166
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Topher?

167
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Josh. I'm so sorry, man.

168
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A sour macaroon?

169
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't even know what that means.

170
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No worries. I love you, man.

171
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I love you too, man.

172
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, brother.

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If it isn't our troupe of
strolling fruitcakes come to save the day.

174
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
With what? Love?

175
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nice try. I've got this.

176
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait.

177
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Love is stronger than any gun.

178
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you sure about that?

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not sure about that, no.

180
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's right, copper.

181
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And who the hell are you?

182
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You don't recognize me, Sergeant Rivera?

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, I suppose I can't blame you.

184
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It has been 20 years
since you sent me to prison

185
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
for the murder of my wife, Daisy.

186
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Dooley Blight?

187
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the flesh.

188
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And thirsty for revenge.

189
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait.

190
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Daisy was my mother's name.

191
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello, my daughter.

192
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No.

193
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have no father.

194
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jenny. Jenny, believe me,
I never harmed your mother.

195
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I loved her more than life itself.

196
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I wish I could believe that, but I don't.

197
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want nothing to do with you.

198
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then I may as well
leave this hell for the next.

199
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No!

200
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Stop! Stop!

201
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's telling the truth.

202
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I know...

203
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
because I'm the one who framed him.

204
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Kratt killed your mother, not Dooley.

205
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who wants to help me stop a wedding?

206
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I do!

207
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you, Octavius, take Melissa
to be your lawful wedded wife?

208
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I do.

209
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you, Melissa, take Octavius
to be your lawful wedded husband?

210
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have no choice.

211
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That counts!

212
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then by the power vested in me
by the city of Schmicago,

213
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I pronounce you ma--

214
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Stop the wedding!

215
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Josh!

216
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You. How did you--

217
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You need to shut your stupid mouth
and get away from my wife.

218
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Seize him.

219
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What?

220
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Officers, stand down!

221
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you think you're doing?

222
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Standing up to you. For once.

223
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And so am I.

224
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Enough is enough, Octavius!

225
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm afraid the two of you
have overplayed your hand.

226
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They don't answer to you.
They answer to me.

227
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I love you, Mel!
And I'm so sorry for this whole mess!

228
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I love you too! No matter what happens,
I'll always love you!

229
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Enough of this prattle.
Pronounce us man and wife.

230
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
By the power vested in me by the city of
Schmicago, I now pronounce you--

231
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Vengeance!

232
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Dooley Blight?

233
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is mine!

234
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, Daddy, no!

235
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You just keep on losing,
don't you, Blight?

236
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Not so fast, my sweet.

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Finish the ceremony.

238
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr. Kratt, as your lawyer, I must advise--
Myself to sit back down.

239
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Finish it!

240
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, um, then by the power vested in me
by the city Schmicago,

241
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I pronounce you man and--

242
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Look up!

243
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, shit.

244
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Seriously? Again?

245
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It really is a wonderful knife.

246
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
My love.

247
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you all right? - Yeah, I am now.

248
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I love you.

249
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I love you.

250
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Is he dead?

251
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now that Kratt is dead, things are
about to change in Schmicago.

252
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Madam Frau will take over the club

253
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and use her position
to promote exciting new talent.

254
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Like ex-Sergeant Rivera.

255
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Bobby will team up with the tribe
to split up Kratt's monopolies,

256
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and something incredible will happen.

257
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They all get jobs!

258
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
While Topher and Jenny will find
the perfect home for their talents

259
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
at the orphanage.

260
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because Miss Codwell and Dooley
will go into business together

261
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and make a killing.

262
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, Josh and Melissa now finally have
the happy ending they've been seeking

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and are free to leave Schmicago and go
back to their world.

264
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But why would they?

265
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why return to a place
you were so desperate to leave?

266
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Where bad people triumph,
good people suffer,

267
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and some couples,
no matter how badly they want it,

268
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
will never ever have children?

269
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sure, you-- You probably feel
like you've learned something

270
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
on your brief sojourn here.

271
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And now life is gonna be so much better.
Right?

272
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Didn't you feel that way
when you left Schmigadoon?

273
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That you had gotten your happy ending,

274
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that everything was gonna be okay
from here on out?

275
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But it wasn't, was it?

276
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The magic wore off.

277
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Magic always does,
except here in Schmicago.

278
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here you could be a star.

279
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A beloved leader.

280
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Here all of your dreams
can actually come true.

281
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thanks to you, things are
getting better here for all of us.

282
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can't leave now.
Things are just getting good!

283
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Add 'em up, kiddos. Add 'em up.

284
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, what's it gonna be?
The joyless drudgery of life out there?

285
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Or the magic and excitement here?

286
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you thinking?

287
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you thinking?

288
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think...

289
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
More what?

290
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
More uncertainty? More joylessness?

291
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The only place you're gonna get
what you really want is here.

292
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
All of you.

293
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But it's time for us to go.

294
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you sure?

295
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's gonna be a constant struggle
with more bad days than good ones.

296
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And a very good chance you'll end up
right back where you were.

297
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We know.

298
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You did it! You did it! I knew you would!
I knew you had it in you!

299
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

300
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm so sorry putting you through all this.
I really am, but I had to test you.

301
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And you passed the test, didn't ya!

302
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait, you're smiling? Why are you smiling?

303
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because he works for me.

304
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
For you?

305
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, about that.
I'm not doing this narrator gig no more.

306
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm tired of helping people
figure out their lives.

307
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want a life of my own! With romance!

308
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And it's gonna be with... him.

309
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't hate it.

310
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And that's the moment
the Narrator's life changed.

311
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, I'm happy for you.

312
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

313
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So, can we go home now?

314
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can go home, yes, you can go home,
but that's just the beginning!

315
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's more important
is what you'll take with you when you go!

316
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Wait a minute. Is-- Isn't that--

317
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My brother.

318
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's a little more traditional than I am,
but I still love the guy.

319
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Shall we, Oscar?

320
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Of course, Steve.
