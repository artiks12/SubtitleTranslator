{\an8}[bell on door jingles]

3
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:54,306
{\an8}Hey, Mr. Johnson. Are you still open?

4
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:01,687
You're the kid that tried to crack open
the machine with a screwdriver.

5
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:05,274
Yeah, I'm Xander.
I didn't know if you'd remember me.

6
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,360
Uh, I got "Gum" from the MORPHO.

7
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:12,574
And you took my photo, but then
you never put it on your wall. [chuckles]

8
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,619
Whoa. Sweet sword, Mr. Johnson.

9
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,039
Yeah.

10
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:20,831
I bought it off Giorgio,

11
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:25,169
thinking I could maybe use it
to saw people in half, but, um...

12
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,048
Oh, right.
You had your big magic show tonight.

13
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:30,925
Sorry. [chuckles]
I wanted to come, but I was working.

14
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:34,221
Well, you didn't miss much.
Most of my tricks didn't work.

15
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:39,017
I'm starting to think
I might not be a magician after all.

16
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,478
Maybe this will cheer you up.

17
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:47,691
The antenna was busted when I found it,

18
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:49,653
but I figured out how to fix it.

19
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,656
You know what I used?

20
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,325
Gum.

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,953
[Xander grunts]

22
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:01,206
You thought this would cheer me up?

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,792
Well, I thought you might want it,
to go with the other one.

24
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,753
- The other what?
- The other machine.

25
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,301
- What makes you think this goes with that?
- Look inside.

26
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,572
Ta-da!

27
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,217
What are you thinking about?

28
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,261
Are you thinking about
how your mother betrayed you

29
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:59,097
and tried to turn the whole town
against you?

30
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,558
- [sighs] Yeah.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,437
Yeah, that's what I thought
you might be thinking about.

32
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,608
- What are you thinking about?
- I'm thinking about that too, yeah.

33
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:14,487
And just feeling utterly enraged
on your behalf.

34
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:19,033
Uh, see, I think after this,
I'm gonna have to cut your mother off.

35
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:23,245
Not have her around for dinner
or talk to her at all anymore, maybe.

36
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,830
You'd do that for me?

37
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,498
It would be a great sacrifice...

38
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,834
- [chuckles]
- ...but I'd be willing to try.

39
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:33,173
I've also been thinking about
this minor revelation that I had tonight.

40
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,508
[Dusty inhales sharply]

41
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:39,094
- When Mr. Johnson had me up on stage...
- Mm-hmm.

42
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,848
...and was making me remember what
it felt like to be skiing at Whistler,

43
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,227
it was like something shifted inside me.

44
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:49,272
So? What does that mean?

45
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,857
You wanna go back to Whistler?

46
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,236
No. I don't know what it means.

47
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,573
What did it mean to you
when you got "Royalty"?

48
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,367
You wanna ask me now?

49
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,494
I am. I'm asking you now,

50
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:06,705
which I know is very late,
but I do wanna know.

51
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,958
[sighs]

52
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,339
I think I just felt like
I had some value or something.

53
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,384
You didn't feel like you had any value?

54
00:04:18,677 --> 00:04:20,470
N-No. No, I did.

55
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,558
Something shifted in me too,

56
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:31,231
and I felt like maybe it was okay
to wanna be...

57
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:33,942
seen.

58
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,736
It's... That's pathetic, but...

59
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,573
No. No, that's not pathetic.

60
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:45,077
It's not. Hey, you wanna talk pathetic?
Let's talk about Giorgio, huh?

61
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,747
Swanning around in his big wig
like a porno John Travolta,

62
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,666
stuffing God-knows-what
down his underpants.

63
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,334
Wait. Giorgio wears a wig?

64
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,545
- Yes! I've been dying to tell you...
- [laughing]

65
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:57,256
...but so much other stuff
has been happening.

66
00:04:57,257 --> 00:05:01,385
Just, um, FYI, I still sleep next door.
You guys literally couldn't be any louder.

67
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,511
Sorry, sweetie. We'll shut up.

68
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,555
Yeah,
we were just talking revelations, honey.

69
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:06,308
Is your revelation that it's 2:00 a.m.?

70
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,976
No, no. No, I was just saying to your mom

71
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:13,397
that maybe everything is
not quite as it seems.

72
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,482
Whoa. Yeah, that's deep.

73
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:19,445
You know what? Yeah, I changed my mind.
I'm actually glad you woke me up for this.

74
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,655
No, no, no. Listen, listen.
What I'm saying is,

75
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,867
what if "Teacher/Whistler"
doesn't really mean "Teacher/Whistler"?

76
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:25,910
[Cass, Trina] Mmm.

77
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,495
Just like "Royalty"
doesn't literally mean "Royalty."

78
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,706
Maybe "Potter"
doesn't literally mean "Potter."

79
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:34,793
I didn't get "Potter." I got "Liar,"
which I'm assuming had to do with the fact

80
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:37,296
that I was cheating on Kolton
with his twin brother before he died

81
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:40,216
and lying to him about it
and lying to everyone about it,

82
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:43,636
and I've been seeing Jacob and lying
to everyone about that ever since.

83
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:48,891
But if you have a different interpretation
of what "Liar" could mean,

84
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,644
I would love to hear it.

85
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,566
- I would have to have a think about that.
- Mmm.

86
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,860
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,821
Trina, I'm... I'm so sorry. [stammers]

88
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,074
Why are you sorry?

89
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,200
Because...

90
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,371
I'm sorry that you felt like you couldn't
come and talk to us about this.

91
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:13,123
I just feel like, "Oh, fuck. We really...
We really dropped the ball on this."

92
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:18,088
- Mm-hmm.
- It's okay. I'm, like, fine.

93
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,091
- [Dusty] Oh.
- [cries]

94
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,387
[Cass grunts] Mmm.

95
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,430
You know,
I don't know if now is the right time,

96
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,685
but I've... I've always thought that Jacob
was a better fit for you, as it happens.

97
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:36,230
I... I'd say that now...
Now's not the right time to say that.

98
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:39,234
- [Trina] I would agree. [sniffling]
- [Cass] Oh.

99
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:44,238
"This is a new day in Deerfield,"
Mayor Izzy proclaimed

100
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,449
while fixing my gaze with a roguish smile.

101
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,079
I took another sip of my ashwagandha tea
as I waited for her to continue.

102
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,584
"Apparently," she sputtered,
"the silent majority of MORPHO Mistrusters

103
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,919
has called for a return to normalcy..."

104
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,337
Nobody is calling for that.

105
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,798
"...which is why she feels
she has no other choice

106
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,717
but to continue on as mayor

107
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:08,178
and proceed with preparations
for this year's Deerfest.

108
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,974
Natalie Pearl, <i>Deerfield Digest</i>."

109
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,268
- [stammers] Yeah, but... [scoffs]
- Thank you.

110
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:17,479
...I would rather eat Giorgio's wig
than attend this year's Deerfest.

111
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,274
And you can print that as my response.

112
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,902
Okay, I don't know if you're joking,
but if Giorgio has a wig,

113
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:25,404
I will print that
because that's a huge story.

114
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:29,199
And secondly, yes,
you will go to Deerfest. We always go.

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,035
I can't go anywhere
without people looking at me

116
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,953
like I'm some kind of fraud
or scam artist,

117
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:36,540
and I refuse
to let Izzy rub that in my face.

118
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,959
- Well, you know she's going to, right?
- [scoffs]

119
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,170
Most people still believe in the machine,
and they know

120
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,421
you had nothing to do with it.

121
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:44,215
Excuse me. Cass?

122
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:47,092
I heard that you're giving people
money back for their sweatshirts.

123
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,136
Yes, Sheila.
Anything that is MORPHO-related

124
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,763
that people wanna give back, they...

125
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,932
- Whoa. Are you taking that off right now?
- Ooh.

126
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,142
- Do you have something on under there?
- No.

127
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:56,602
So, what is the play here?

128
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,896
Also, I don't think
that's one of your sweatshirts.

129
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:01,482
The letters are all wrong,
and they're peeling.

130
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:04,902
Yeah, and I don't even think
you got "Rockstar," Sheila.

131
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:07,780
You were painting rocks
way before the machine arrived.

132
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:11,492
{\an8}Okay, Sheila,
let my friends enjoy their dinner.

133
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,119
- Uh... Sheila! What the...
- Bye, Sheila.

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,706
Can I take the opportunity,
with all of you here,

135
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,625
just to say sorry again

136
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,920
about trying to win Cass's heart
and break up your <i>famiglia</i>?

137
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,547
- Yeah, you can.
- We've talked about it.

138
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:27,258
- Wait a minute. What happened?
- I was in a really weird place.

139
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,009
Yeah, you were on a gondola
trying to fuck my mom.

140
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,223
But I think I'm finally almost ready
to open my heart up to new adventures.

141
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,391
[exhales sharply]

142
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:37,184
That's not as conclusive
as I'd like it to be.

143
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,687
I've been getting a lot of guidance
from someone

144
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,605
that I would love
for you to meet, actually.

145
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,525
Cary. Cary, get over here.

146
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:45,484
<i>Buona sera</i>, everyone.

147
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,653
- Grandpa!
- [chuckles] Hello, Dad.

148
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,697
Oh! Oh, that's right, D.

149
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:52,741
- I almost forgot Cary's also your dad.
- Did you?

150
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,494
Ever since we collabed on that video
for Cass's fundraiser,

151
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,913
I've been having Care Bear over here
model some of my merch

152
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,373
with his insanely jacked body.

153
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,792
Ah, Giorgio, come on.
I'm not insanely jacked.

154
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,128
I just move a little weight around,
that's all.

155
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,172
Nah, you've been moving me
with your wisdom of life, Mr. C.

156
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:08,591
That's not his name.

157
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:12,094
I guess you could say that Big C
has become a bit of a male model for me

158
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,221
- in my life in more ways than one.
- [breathes deeply]

159
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,891
Male model? Dad,
that's kind of like you and "Whistler."

160
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:19,519
- See? Like, they mean different things.
- Mmm.

161
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:24,899
Okay. So, what pearls of wisdom
have you shared with our Giorgio, Dad?

162
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,694
Oh, well... [stammers] ...nothing
I haven't tried to instill in our Dust.

163
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,614
Face your fear.
Don't dwell in the "what-ifs."

164
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:34,950
You know, "What if people laugh at me
for trying to be a male model at my age?"

165
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,911
"What if I lose my accounting firm?"

166
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:40,581
Or, "What if my wife meets another man
in Europe and never comes back?"

167
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:42,917
- [chuckles]
- "What if the whole town hates me?"

168
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,336
Yeah. You gotta face your fear.

169
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,797
Otherwise, you'll never know
what's on the other side of it.

170
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:52,635
[announcer on PA]
<i>Good morning, Deerfield Hooves.</i>

171
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,638
<i>This is Axel the "Meteorologist"
with your daily weather report.</i>

172
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,431
<i>I know some of you
might not pay attention to this,</i>

173
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,683
<i>depending on how you feel about
the whole MORPHO controversy.</i>

174
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,893
<i>But for those of you who do,</i>

175
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:03,020
<i>there's a cold front
coming in from the northwest.</i>

176
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:06,357
<i>High pressure mixing with warm winds
from the east means a storm's coming.</i>

177
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:07,608
A serious storm,

178
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:10,069
which could really put a damper
on the opening of Deerfest tonight,

179
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,695
so make sure you pack your umbrellas.
Make...

180
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:12,988
What are you doing?

181
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,241
Jacob and I are dating.

182
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:17,941
We've been dating for a really long time,
even before Kolton died and ever since.

183
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,829
<i>I mean, we did break up for a bit,
and now we're back together.</i>

184
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,624
But the point is that we're dating,
and we don't wanna keep it a secret.

185
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,460
What the hell is going on in here?
You just can't jump on the PA!

186
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,673
I know, and I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to do something really brave.

187
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,258
I'm facing my fear.

188
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,680
Okay. Well, get on with it, then.

189
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:44,145
This is Trina, by the way. Trina Hubbard.

190
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:49,734
I probably should've said that before,
and it's okay if you all hate me now.

191
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,653
<i>Although, I'd really be much happier
if you didn't hate Jacob</i>

192
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,154
<i>because he's a very good boy.</i>

193
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:57,450
<i>And the only person
we really owe an apology to is Kolton,</i>

194
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,536
<i>but he's not here,</i>

195
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:01,955
which means he can't hate us

196
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:06,293
and hate us less over time
and then forgive us, hopefully,

197
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:08,294
which really fucking sucks,

198
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:11,590
because I don't want to be a "Liar"
forever.

199
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:20,724
Oh.

200
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,143
Um...

201
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:28,105
Also, there is a meeting
of the junior jazz band after school

202
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,523
<i>in Room 206.</i>

203
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:32,902
<i>According to this piece of paper,
they are performing at Deerfest tonight</i>

204
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,529
<i>in the arts-and-crafts tent,
so check 'em out.</i>

205
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,697
[PA system chimes]

206
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,407
[all murmuring]

207
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,117
Yeah, some hero, man.

208
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:41,410
I never said I was a hero.

209
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:44,038
You should've said something.
You knew that I liked you.

210
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,582
And you made me feel like
there was something wrong with me.

211
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,918
Yeah, because this is about you, Savannah.

212
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,212
[sighs]
I can't believe Trina would do this.

213
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,838
She's such a skanky little bitch.

214
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,216
Hey, maybe you're the skanky little bia...

215
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:57,676
- [all murmuring]
- I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

216
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:01,181
That was a mistake, and that's okay.
We are allowed to make mistakes.

217
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:05,517
Trina and Jacob just made a mistake,
and they are owning that mistake, so...

218
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,978
She's owning it.

219
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,981
Sorry?

220
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,482
Thanks for the heads-up.

221
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,984
It would have been really awesome
to have talked about this earlier.

222
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:15,695
We did talk about it.

223
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,530
We agreed
that it sucked not being together.

224
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:22,243
First you told me not to say anything.
Then you went and told my dad first.

225
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:24,370
Then you told your parents.
Now you've told the entire school.

226
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:28,415
And it's just... It's always on your terms,
and I have no part in it at all.

227
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,583
That's not true.

228
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,961
He was my brother, you know.

229
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:34,672
- I know that.
- I'm sorry. You told Jacob's dad first?

230
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:35,756
I didn't mean to.

231
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:36,924
It just kind of came out

232
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:40,636
that night that you and Mom were
at the cruise thing having your threesome.

233
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,763
- [all murmuring]
- [Dusty] Hold on. We weren't...

234
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:44,431
No, it wasn't a threesome.

235
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:48,185
No, uh... We were
on a normal, romantic, marital getaway

236
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,979
until some bodily mishaps

237
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,398
and some emotional surprises
got in the way.

238
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,483
I told you
it would spice up your marriage.

239
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:56,860
- You use the coupon?
- Course I used the coupon.

240
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,613
But I don't think any of that is
appropriate in front of the students.

241
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,323
Well, your daughter started this.

242
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:03,075
[inhales sharply] Yeah.

243
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,286
I'm really surprised
that you told Beau before me.

244
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:08,748
And, Jacob, it feels like we had bonded,
you know?

245
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,458
- Could've mentioned it then when we were...
- Smoking weed?

246
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,087
When we were talking about relationships
at the store that time,

247
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,298
which I now realize was me
giving you advice

248
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,091
about how to get with my own daughter.

249
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,572
You were smoking weed with a student?

250
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,556
- People make mistakes.
- [murmuring]

251
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,600
It's called being human.

252
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:31,520
We need to make mistakes,
especially when we're young.

253
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,981
I'm not just saying this.
This isn't a lecture.

254
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:37,903
If there was one thing
that I could say to you as your dad,

255
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:42,615
and to all of you as your "Teacher,"
it would be this:

256
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:44,910
don't be afraid to make mistakes.

257
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:48,454
Look at all the fully-grown people
out there who have suddenly,

258
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:49,580
because of a machine,

259
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:52,166
decided that they don't like what they do
for a living,

260
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:57,379
or they don't like their garage
or their partner or themselves.

261
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,050
You know what?
I wish I had made more mistakes.

262
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,968
Wish I'd taken bigger swings.

263
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:05,095
I don't know what the MORPHO means,

264
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:08,432
but I do know
that it has made a lot of people realize

265
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:12,812
that they want change
and that they can still change.

266
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:16,608
And once you see the potential of that,
there's no going back.

267
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:20,402
Well, I know I don't wanna go back.

268
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:23,697
I mean, I wouldn't get much trade-in value
on my Harley,

269
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,449
especially after the accident.

270
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,953
And I don't wanna think I wasn't meant
to be with Farid.

271
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:31,121
But I have a neighbor

272
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,166
who's been practicing the bow and arrow
for a month,

273
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,044
and she shot an arrow clean
through her husband's shoulder.

274
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,462
- Whoa.
- Mmm, she all right.

275
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:42,968
But now she doesn't know if it means
her potential isn't really "Archer,"

276
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,344
or if she's just in her head about it.

277
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:46,428
That's it.

278
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,847
- [inhales deeply]
- [smacks table]

279
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:52,393
That's it! Yes, sir!

280
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:53,894
[chuckles] Oh, my God.

281
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:55,896
- Oh, that's so clear now.
- Is everything okay in here?

282
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:57,856
Yeah, he's just having another revelation.

283
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:01,569
I've been trying to think of the word
for it, and that's it.

284
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,614
The thing that's written on the card,
your "life potential."

285
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,199
That's not the job you're meant to have,

286
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,994
or the destiny, or your goals,
or whatever.

287
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:14,708
It's not the end of the road.
It's a turn. It's an arrow.

288
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,085
It's a thing you need to be told
about yourself

289
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,671
to point you in the right direction.

290
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:24,633
Sweetheart, you needed to be told
that you could be a "Liar"

291
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,261
in order to tell the truth.

292
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:31,015
And Jacob, who is filled
with this constant anxiety

293
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:34,184
because he thinks he can't live up
to the reputation of his "Hero" brother,

294
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:37,187
is then given a card
that says he, too, can be a "Hero,"

295
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,982
and he has to confront that.

296
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:40,984
[imitates explosion]

297
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:46,489
And Axel,
you got "Meteorologist" in order to...

298
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:51,661
I don't know. Maybe it was just
to help you believe in yourself,

299
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:53,746
which is exactly what your mom said

300
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:55,831
on the first night
that we ever talked about this.

301
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:59,461
Or maybe you're gonna be really good
at predicting storms. I don't know.

302
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:03,506
But what I do know is that we have been
asking the wrong questions.

303
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,050
We've been asking
where the MORPHO came from,

304
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,052
and what's inside it,
and how does it work.

305
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:11,722
But what we should have been asking is,
"What's inside of us? How do we work?

306
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:14,475
And why, of all places in this big world,

307
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:17,394
did the MORPHO machine come
to fucking Deerfield?"

308
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,480
That's what I wanna know.

309
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,564
I'm proud of you.

310
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,692
[students muttering]

311
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:27,655
I have not even started this lesson.
Do you mind?

312
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,908
- Okay. You got that.
- I'm sorry.

313
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,369
[Beau] For a guy who knows jack shit
about basketball

314
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,248
and is a mediocre boxer at best,

315
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:38,916
it sounds like
Dusty's not a terrible teacher.

316
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,418
He made some interesting points.

317
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,879
Did he actually say the thing
about people changing their garages?

318
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,965
Because that feels like
it was directed at me specifically.

319
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,133
Oh, it definitely was.

320
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,264
Well, I don't care.

321
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:54,099
I like this saloon.

322
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,435
I like it too.

323
00:16:58,395 --> 00:16:59,396
- Really?
- Yeah.

324
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,606
For a while, I thought nothing
would ever make you happy again.

325
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:03,649
Oh.

326
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,525
Also, I like how you can close the door

327
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,530
and kind of imagine
that you're somewhere else.

328
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:13,492
We can go somewhere else if you want.
Have you thought of that?

329
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:14,577
What, like running away?

330
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:17,161
[inhales deeply] If we do it together,
I think it's called moving.

331
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,246
Oh.

332
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,125
I know that's kinda the opposite
of Dusty's thing

333
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,959
about owning your mistakes,

334
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,089
but I also know things
can really stick to you in a small town.

335
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,758
I threw up once on a ninth-grade
field trip to the botanical gardens,

336
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,177
and people have called me
"Barfy Beau" for 20 years.

337
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:33,554
I've never heard anyone call you that.

338
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:36,224
It's pretty much all I'm known for.
[chuckles]

339
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,770
And now they'll probably call me
"sad cowboy" or some shit.

340
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:44,940
And they'll call you "the twin brother
of the dead basketball star

341
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,484
who cheated with his girlfriend,"
or I don't know.

342
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,655
They'll come up with something catchier
and more hurtful, probably.

343
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,201
[inhales deeply] Okay... [sighs] ...fine.

344
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:57,995
Let's do it. Let's... [chuckling]

345
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:00,456
Let's run away.
Let's light out for the territories.

346
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:02,167
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

347
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:05,502
Okay, you got it.

348
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:07,713
- [chuckles] I'll start packing.
- [chuckles]

349
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:10,132
What do we need?
The throat roaster, obviously.

350
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:11,843
Obviously, yeah.

351
00:18:14,471 --> 00:18:15,471
And the chainsaw.

352
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,181
In what scenario
would we need to take the chainsaw?

353
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:19,767
In what scenario
would we not take the chainsaw?

354
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:21,937
- Yeah, good point. Yeah.
- [both chuckle]

355
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:27,174
You know,

356
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:31,404
I didn't realize that Trina told me
before she told anyone else.

357
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:33,907
That's pretty cool.

358
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:38,160
I mean, not cool, but ballsy.

359
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,246
[chuckles]

360
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:42,414
That girl's got a real pair of nuts
on her, doesn't she?

361
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:44,042
[chuckles]

362
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:47,671
Yeah. She does.

363
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,051
Hmm, I don't know why you're doing this.
Is this, like,

364
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,971
a "thank you for being an absent,
shitty mother" present?

365
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,390
No, it's just... just a little thing.

366
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,141
There's, like, zero chance

367
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,269
that this won't make me feel worse
about myself.

368
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,312
Open it.

369
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:05,897
[Cass] Aw.

370
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,567
Look at that. It's a pretty vase.
It's so beautiful.

371
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:11,443
- Did you make this?
- Yeah.

372
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:14,405
- And it's actually more of a chalice.
- [gasps] Oh.

373
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,909
Kind of like
what a queen would drink out of.

374
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:22,788
All right. That's cool.
And yeah, I was right. [chuckles]

375
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:26,041
It's also 99% sure to fall apart
at any second, so...

376
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,878
Cool. Same.

377
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:31,172
- When did you make this?
- I don't know.

378
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:35,927
Kinda just whenever I have the time
to take my mind off of things.

379
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:46,478
Trina, sweetie, I know
that I have not been paying attention

380
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,564
to everything
that you've been going through lately.

381
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:52,776
I was at the magic show
and at Giorgio's before with Grizzy,

382
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:55,988
- and I saw what she did to you.
- [doorbell ringing]

383
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,072
Mmm.

384
00:19:57,073 --> 00:20:00,409
Your mom is way more fucked up
than my mom.

385
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,493
[Dusty] Don't worry. I'll get it!

386
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,163
I mean, I'm upstairs,
and you two are right there.

387
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:05,873
But no, makes more sense for me to get it.

388
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,875
- [sighs]
- Geez Louise.

389
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,628
- Eat chainsaw, asshole!
- Whoa! For God's sake. [sighs]

390
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,129
Yeah, I'm here to murder you,

391
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,757
because your daughter hooked up
with both my sons!

392
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:16,550
Okay. Jesus. Okay, chill. Chill.

393
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,427
I'm really sorry.
I told him I was coming here.

394
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:21,472
And he said he had a "killer joke idea,"
which I guess is what that was.

395
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:24,183
- Did you see that, Jacob? His face.
- Yeah, I saw his face, Dad.

396
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,267
Is it okay if I...

397
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,603
Yeah, please come in. [sighs]

398
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:28,854
- [Jacob] I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

399
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:31,982
- [Beau] I'm sorry I called you an asshole.
- Yeah, I know, it was really funny.

400
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:33,108
[sighs]

401
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,361
Hey.

402
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:38,405
Hey. What's up?

403
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,698
Hi, Mrs. Hubbard.

404
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:40,784
Hi, Jacob.

405
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,409
Cool.

406
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,623
Um, I was wondering if you wanted
to go with me to Deerfest tonight?

407
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:50,251
Like, on a date.
Like, yeah... Like a first date.

408
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:53,170
You know that Cass and I's first date,
we went to Deerfest.

409
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,338
- Dusty...
- [Dusty] Yeah.

410
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,257
We can talk about it a different time.
Go on.

411
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:58,968
Well, I was just thinking,
now that everyone knows everything,

412
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:01,220
- we could...
- I'm sorry I didn't talk to you first.

413
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:02,721
Oh, it's okay.

414
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:06,934
I'm-I'm... I'm glad you had the courage
to go and do that.

415
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:09,270
And now maybe we can, like,
try to get to know each other

416
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,063
- and see if we actually like each other.
- [chuckles]

417
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:13,566
Again, maybe not the time,
but I've always thought that you two...

418
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,151
- Dad.
- Dusty.

419
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,571
So, do you wanna go to Deerfest?

420
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:19,488
Can my parents come?

421
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:21,073
- [Beau blows raspberry]
- [parents chuckle]

422
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:22,950
- Trina with the jokes.
- No, I'm not joking.

423
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:24,910
It's like...
We used to go together all the time,

424
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,581
and, I don't know, I just kinda want
something normal right now.

425
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:31,333
Going to a deer-themed festival
on your first date with your parents?

426
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:32,626
I know you don't wanna go.

427
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:35,087
Grizzy will be there,
and it's, like, a whole thing...

428
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:38,966
Oh, no. I'll go. Um, I'll go.
I don't care if she's there.

429
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,260
And people are definitely
gonna give you looks

430
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:42,761
- because of the fake card thing.
- Mmm.

431
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:44,889
- Well, I think we're gonna get more looks.
- Fair.

432
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,974
- [Jacob] So...
- Oh, we're gonna get a lot of looks.

433
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:49,895
I am okay with that, seriously,
if that's what you wanna do.

434
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:52,146
All right, Beau.

435
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:55,691
Baby girl wants to go to Deerfest,
so wanna go to Deerfest?

436
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:57,484
Does this answer your question?

437
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:58,611
[chainsaw whirs]

438
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:01,030
Whoo! Deerfest!

439
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:02,574
- That's not funny!
- [laughs] Yeah!

440
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:04,867
- Not in the house!
- Oh. Sorry.

441
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,870
- Not in the house, Beau!
- Sorry!

442
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:14,961
Excuse me.

443
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,087
Sorry to interrupt your socializing,

444
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,840
but maybe you've noticed
we're about to open Deerfest,

445
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,927
and I'm just curious about
when you plan to finish the hay maze?

446
00:22:22,928 --> 00:22:24,011
It is finished.

447
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,096
Oh, is it?

448
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:27,556
Then why can I see
right over the hay bales?

449
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:30,017
It needs to be twice as high as this.

450
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:31,268
It's for kids.

451
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:33,479
And you assume a child
won't appreciate a challenge.

452
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,565
- Excuse me, Mayor Fontaine?
- [scoffs] Can't you see I'm busy?

453
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:40,111
- You know there's a storm coming?
- I know there's a storm forecasted.

454
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:42,405
Why do you think we have ponchos?

455
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:45,658
I suppose you'd be happier
if everybody just stayed home.

456
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,742
Well, I think I would.

457
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:49,161
If there's lightning,
the hay bales will go up like a torch.

458
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,372
What qualifications do you have
to make this assessment?

459
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:54,793
Well, I did get a card that said
"Sole Survivor" from the MORPHO machine.

460
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,545
It's my first time being out the house
in a month.

461
00:22:57,546 --> 00:23:00,047
So I'm still a bit nervous
about things I could survive.

462
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:01,131
Honey, please.

463
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:03,426
You don't know the first thing
about survival.

464
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:09,057
[sighs]

465
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:11,476
[thunder rumbles]

466
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:18,483
What was that? Sounded like thunder.

467
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:21,213
It was probably just one of the rides.

468
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,989
Trina, if you get scared,
you know that you can hold Daddy's hand.

469
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,575
- Or we can link arms...
- God.

470
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:29,118
- ...like <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.
- Yes! Yes.

471
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,664
- Okay, I already regret inviting you.
- [both laughing]

472
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:35,584
Hey, Father Reuben! Deerfest is that way!

473
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,920
Oh, I told Father Reuben
about my whole, uh, arrow theory.

474
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,298
He was very impressed.

475
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:43,757
Seems the teacher
has become the "Teacher."

476
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:46,260
Yeah, I've been thinking about that
a lot actually.

477
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:47,637
Mmm, it's pretty good, right?

478
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:50,431
Yeah.

479
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:51,599
What?

480
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,059
- Nothing.
- What?

481
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:56,646
No, I... [sighs]

482
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,608
I guess I'm just wondering if...

483
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,902
If this is all about a turn in the road
like you said...

484
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:03,986
Mm-hmm?

485
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,489
...then what if we don't turn together?

486
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,367
How do you mean?

487
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:14,623
What if our arrows don't point
in the same direction?

488
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:19,711
I don't know.

489
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,598
[thunder rumbles]

490
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:39,689
Hello?

491
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,660
[banging]

492
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,121
[Hana speaks indistinctly]

493
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:02,378
[grunts]

494
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:03,797
- Hana.
- [gasps]

495
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,132
What you doing?

496
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,387
Just trying to fix this hole in the roof
before the big storm comes.

497
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:13,722
So, you've been listening
to Axel's weather reports, huh?

498
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:17,351
Um, I don't know who Axel is,
but I've been listening to the news.

499
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:18,936
What do you normally do when it rains?

500
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,230
I have an elaborate system
called a bucket.

501
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:23,440
But I don't think it's gonna cut it
for this one,

502
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:26,236
and I don't wanna wake up
in six feet of water, so...

503
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,738
Wait, what do you mean "wake up"?

504
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:31,700
Yeah, this is my room.

505
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,037
Oh, I'm s... I'm sorry. I...

506
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:38,373
I didn't realize you slept here.

507
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:43,752
It looks more like the room
of a small child who died 80 years ago.

508
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:46,380
Thanks.
That's the aesthetic I was going for.

509
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,966
- Where's all your things?
- [sighs] I like to travel light.

510
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,595
Actually got rid of a bunch of stuff
right when I got here.

511
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:54,222
Why did you come here?

512
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:58,727
What do you mean?

513
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:01,980
What led you to this town, of all places?

514
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,442
I could ask you the same thing.

515
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:09,194
I came because there was an opening
at the high school for a chaplain.

516
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:13,283
- Same. But I guess you got it.
- Hana, I'm serious. I wanna know.

517
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:16,286
Why did you come here now?

518
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:19,998
What are you doing here, Father?

519
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,963
I don't wanna be a priest anymore.

520
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,604
Well, this could be a problem. [sighs]

521
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:47,317
[theremin squealing]

522
00:27:14,094 --> 00:27:15,595
[squealing stops]

523
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,431
Abracadabra.

524
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:34,531
[bell on door jingles]

525
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,036
Mr. Johnson?

526
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,376
[alarm blaring]

527
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:57,387
[grunting]

528
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,098
Mr. Johnson!

529
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:09,774
Oh, shoot.
