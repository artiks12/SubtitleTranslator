1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,003
Jamie Tartt collects.

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,006
He's been Richmond's unequivocal
talisman today.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,842
He finds Rojas and it's there!

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,015
Richmond have beaten
Aston Villa three-nil,

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,352
with an offensive display
as dazzling as it is unfamiliar.

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,940
AFC Richmond make it
two decisive wins in a row.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,817
Southampton never knew what hit them.

8
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:30,030
Bumbercatch with a 95th-minute winner
over Tottenham.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,617
The dog track has gone absolutely potty!

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,162
Another sensational win
for Richmond away at Everton.

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,374
That's four in a row. Amazing.
Life is good for the Greyhounds.

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,752
It's a lucky streak.
What goes up always comes down.

13
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,879
Exciting times on Nelson Road,

14
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:50,133
and you have to think that no one
is happier than Coach Ted Lasso.

15
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,685
I'm glad this little trip
worked out for y'all.

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,563
Yeah. Henry's really excited
to spend the weekend with you.

17
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,272
Oh, yeah. Well, you know…

18
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:07,276
I'll take face-to-face time
over FaceTime anytime.

19
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:12,114
Yeah. And you know, I wanna say,
it's been nice to…

20
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,533
Get to remeet you, Dr. Jacob.

21
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,786
Ted, please. I insist, just call me Jake.

22
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,831
You got it, Jake.

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,166
Oh, nope. Still feels weird to me,
you know?

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,171
Like whenever I hear white
folks call Jay-Z "Jigga man," you know?

25
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,006
Or like when you see
a priest wearing shorts.

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,966
Yeah, exactly. Weird, you know?

27
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,011
Or when you get pulled over
by a cop who's the same age as you.

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,846
You're like, "Come on, man, be cool."

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,556
"What we doing here?" You know?

30
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,393
Can I get some more money
for the pinball, please?

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,103
- Yeah, let's see...
- Yeah.

32
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,440
- You go. You go ahead.
- Okay.

33
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,317
I don't know what I have. Let's see.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,156
There are some magnets I gotta bring back
to work and a matchbook.

35
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,366
Maybe I do. Let me just see. I got... No.

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,160
A pocketful of American coins

37
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:02,080
and a complimentary sleep mask that
did not fit 'cause I have a huge head.

38
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:07,169
Come on, Prince Henry. I rigged
the machine so you can play without coins.

39
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,586
You said that was impossible.

40
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,426
Here you go.
Two English breakfasts. Enjoy.

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,969
Thank you.

42
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,054
Nothing's impossible.

43
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:25,103
I should wash my hands
'cause I touched dirty money.

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,189
I'm a hand-wash guy, Ted.

45
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,273
Yeah.

46
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,735
He's a hand-wash guy.

47
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,363
- Well, better safe than sorry.
- Yeah. Right?

48
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,074
- Are you sure you're not hungry?
- No, I'm good.

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,284
I had a big old piece of cereal at home.

50
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,119
- Okay.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,205
Besides, you know, English breakfast to me

52
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,041
is just a pile of a bunch
of little, tiny piles, you know?

53
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,334
But please, help yourself.

54
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,337
You're gonna need your strength,
hiking around that English countryside.

55
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,423
Oh, yeah. About that.

56
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,675
Yeah?

57
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,053
Jake told me on the plane
he's actually taking me to Paris.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,848
It was a surprise.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,059
Paris.

60
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,272
Great, yeah. Which one?

61
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:13,569
You know, Paris, Texas? Paris, Arkansas?
Paris, Ohio? Or the other Paris in Ohio?

62
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,573
Actually,
I think there's three Parises in Ohio.

63
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,199
Or do you say "Parese"? Par...

64
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,453
"Paris" Paris. You know, in France.

65
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,666
The default Paris.

66
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,710
Right.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,463
Cool. Well, that's gonna be real…

68
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,135
I wish I knew the French word for "nice."

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
Très bien.

70
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,139
Très bien.

71
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:24,806
You know, I think hooking up with you
might just be my favorite thing ever.

72
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,267
Yeah?

73
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,479
Yeah. Well, second favorite.

74
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,775
Go on then.

75
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,202
Sorry.

76
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,329
There goes my boner.

77
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,211
My dad told my Uncle Bernie I'm in town,

78
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:59,132
and he's invited me to his big, swanky
polo event tomorrow. Would you wanna go?

79
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:05,138
The one time I've been on a horse
was for a photo shoot years ago.

80
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,059
Horse was so drugged up that it could've
been the guitarist in the Sex Pistols.

81
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,770
No, we don't play.

82
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,356
We just stand around and drink champagne.

83
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,359
- Oh, right. Of course, yeah.
- It's for charity.

84
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,572
You know, celebrities,
red carpet, big trays of tiny food.

85
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,907
It's a whole thing. We should go.

86
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,911
Be fun to show off my girlfriend.

87
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,959
Sounds great. And it gives me
an excuse to go to Harvey Nicks!

88
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,422
Okay, I'll tell Uncle Bernie.
He's gonna love you.

89
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,465
I didn't know your dad had a brother.

90
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:46,138
No, sorry.
"Uncle" Bernie is a family friend.

91
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,558
- Bernard Arnault. He runs...
- Moët and Louis Vuitton!

92
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,020
- Does he need another fake niece?
- You can ask him yourself tomorrow.

93
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,480
That's very cool.

94
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,359
More importantly…

95
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,905
- Where were we?
- Champagne.

96
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,618
Harvey Nicks.

97
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,455
Fake uncles.

98
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,124
Drugged horses.

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,387
Oh, fuck.

100
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,821
- Hey. Morning.
- Morning.

101
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,408
That was nice.

102
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,703
You staying over, I mean. Not the…

103
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,457
Well, that... Obviously, that was nice
as well. I don't...

104
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,211
- Your breath smells good.
- Thank you.

105
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,714
Did you go off and brush your teeth
and then sneak back into bed?

106
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,591
Yeah, I did.

107
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,385
Does my breath smell awful?

108
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,263
Yeah, it does, ac...

109
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,764
Yeah, it is quite bad.

110
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,983
So, look, would you want to go
and grab some breakfast?

111
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,485
I don't know
if you've got plans or what.

112
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,778
No, breakfast sounds good.

113
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,950
You know, I don't have

114
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,079
any meals planned with anybody else
in the foreseeable future.

115
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,039
I don't know. Do you?

116
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,458
No, I don't.

117
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,756
So if someone were to ask about us,

118
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,760
what terminology would you
best recommend describes our relationship?

119
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,972
No, there's no pressure to label us…

120
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,516
You and I. I just... Yeah.

121
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,477
- All right.
- Yeah.

122
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,105
Yeah, no, 'cause I'm just cool.

123
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,733
Just cool and casual. I just...

124
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,739
Me too. Wait. Did you shave?

125
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,951
Yeah, and showered. After I used
the toilet in next door's flat.

126
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,078
Weird.

127
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,346
Wow.

128
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,850
Hi, baby. I know you're all the way up
there in chilly Newcastle,

129
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,187
so here's a little something
to warm you up.

130
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,489
Nope. You're right. I shouldn't watch it.

131
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,871
Shit. How did that get on the Internet?
A private video that...

132
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,916
Apparently, there's been some
massive leak. It's not just you.

133
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,586
It's actresses, singers,
a couple politicians,

134
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,798
some random reality show guy
with a very big dick.

135
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,093
Oh, my God. I can't believe
this is happening. I...

136
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,930
How did that... Fuck! Fuck.

137
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,015
Hey. Hey, hey.

138
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,476
No, this is bad, because my friends
are gonna see this. My family.

139
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,311
- The team.
- Take a breath.

140
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,230
Oh, my God, and the office.
I'm their boss.

141
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,357
Keeley, stop. Take a breath.

142
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,110
Yeah.

143
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,279
I'm so sorry this is happening.

144
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,157
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna take care of it, okay?

145
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,869
Thank you.

146
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,416
Okay, Henry. We have scored excellently
on kit presentation.

147
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,210
Hanger integrity: Insane.

148
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,796
But we did drop a little
on the towel folding, didn't we?

149
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,008
But that's okay. I've been there.
But that does lead us on to our next task,

150
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,302
which is towel placement.

151
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,804
The question is, are you ready?

152
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:57,931
Yeah.

153
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,016
Are you steady?

154
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,642
Yeah.

155
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,936
In that case, go!

156
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,698
Is this a game or child labor?

157
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,117
In late-stage capitalism,
what's the difference?

158
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,244
- Word.
- You're doing really well, Henry.

159
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,372
Then we'll go into the weight room and do
some cleaning next. That'll be great.

160
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,960
Hey, fellas, let me ask you something.

161
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,547
If you could propose to someone,
you know, anywhere in the world,

162
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,674
where would you do it?

163
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,926
Paris.

164
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,221
The Hall of Mirrors
at Linderhof Palace in Germany,

165
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,182
because if she agreed,
I'd be surrounded by a thousand yeses.

166
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,935
Or Paris. Why?

167
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,314
Dr. Jacob is gonna propose to Michelle.

168
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,276
- Yeah.
- Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.

169
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,741
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Yes, I do.

170
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,160
Diamond Dogs, mount up!

171
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,745
Never fucking mind.

172
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,085
What... what's going on?
What... What's the Diamond Dogs?

173
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,837
It's a living fucking nightmare!

174
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,881
The Diamond Dogs are a group of men
committed to supporting each other

175
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,593
by sharing their most intimate thoughts,
feelings and experiences. You in or out?

176
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,928
I'm in.

177
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,263
Goddamn it!

178
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,889
Roy chose "out."

179
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,224
Yeah, I assumed.

180
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,982
Sorry, just...

181
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,528
- I just came as fast as I could.
- Take your time.

182
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,031
- Hey, we appreciate your expediency.
- I got a bit light-headed.

183
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,037
Balance. Okay. I am okay.

184
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,790
First order of business: New member.

185
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,627
Coach, you have the floor.

186
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,005
Dr. Jacob and Michelle
are getting engaged.

187
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,801
It's a hard moment when an ex moves on.

188
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,263
Did he at least ask your permission?

189
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,934
Well, I'm her ex-husband,
not her current father.

190
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,644
So, no, he... No.

191
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,105
How did you find out?

192
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,399
He took her to Paris.

193
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,445
Can you believe that?

194
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,827
That's it?

195
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,955
- Unbelievable.
- What?

196
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,834
Ted, I ran down the stairs for this
and up some other stairs.

197
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,962
I'm gonna have leg cramps
in my sleep tonight.

198
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:37,382
Okay, now, hold on a second, okay?
This is happening, all right?

199
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,802
My man took Michelle to Paris
on a surprise trip.

200
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,095
Why else would he do that?

201
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,597
Can I just talk whenever?

202
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,267
Well, he's right, Ted.

203
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,645
You can't worry about something
that hasn't happened yet.

204
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:56,109
What he said. If anything,
you should find out before you flip out.

205
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,120
"Find out before you flip out," huh?

206
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:12,042
Yeah, okay. No, that... Yeah, you're right.

207
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,296
Of course. Thank you. Yeah. Hey.

208
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,466
All right. Anybody else got something?

209
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,678
Roy,
you got anything you wanna talk about?

210
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,596
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

211
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,807
All right. Well, Diamond Dogs,
disperse then.

212
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,185
Woof!

213
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:47,035
- Am I in trouble?
- No, nothing like that. No. Promise.

214
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,330
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

215
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,500
No, thank you for coming.
Just take a seat. Thank you.

216
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,960
Just waiting on one more.

217
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,212
There you go.

218
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,139
- Are we in trouble?
- No. Nobody's in trouble. Just…

219
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,809
Well, you know, I just don't wanna say it
until everyone's here, so…

220
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,566
I'll call. It's fine. I'll just call.

221
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,571
- Hello, Coach Shelley.
- Hello, Ms. Kakes.

222
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:27,910
I just wondered if Rupert was on his way
to my office for our special meeting.

223
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,454
No, he's not coming to that.

224
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,541
I mean, he said that he would,
so... I mean, is he busy?

225
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,626
No.

226
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,383
It's fine. Don't worry.
I guess it's just us then.

227
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:48,764
For the very first meeting of the...
Drumroll, please.

228
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,892
Love Hounds.

229
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,360
I thought that we men could

230
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,987
get together whenever we needed,
every now and then,

231
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,156
and just talk and help each other out

232
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,158
with how things
are going on in our personal lives.

233
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,535
Okay.

234
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,664
Well, I'd love to talk about the stresses
of taking care of my aging parents.

235
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,123
Yeah, I'll start.

236
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,710
So I... I've started seeing this girl,
and it's going real well.

237
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,295
I really like her. She's great.

238
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,090
But she's hesitant
to label our relationship,

239
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,509
and I don't know whether to give her space

240
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,887
or whether to let her know just how
strongly I feel about us being together.

241
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,727
Disco, would you...
Do you got any thoughts or...

242
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,688
I've been divorced three times.

243
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,899
Never let them know how you feel.
It's very expensive.

244
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:43,819
Okay.

245
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,946
I read this book that said,

246
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,282
"If you like a woman,
you should insult her."

247
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,954
Okay, this meeting's over,
and it'll probably never happen again.

248
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,747
Thank you for coming. Thank you both.

249
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,590
- Are we in trouble now?
- No, Roger. Just go. No. Thank you.

250
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,757
It's all right.

251
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,262
Hey, Boss.

252
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,805
Morning, Ted.

253
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,640
- Here you go.
- Morning. Thank you.

254
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,768
I could use your help.

255
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,980
Of course. Anything. Wait.
Shouldn't you be at training?

256
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,150
Oh, yeah, but don't worry.
I've got that all covered.

257
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,653
Go, go, go, go!

258
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,659
Right. Okay, then. Well, how can I help?

259
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,370
- I need to hire a private investigator.
- Why?

260
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:38,248
'Cause Dr. Jacob took Michelle
to Paris, the French one,

261
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,501
and I'm pretty sure he's gonna propose.

262
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,213
Now I gotta find out if I'm right
so I don't flip out when I am.

263
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,299
Ted, people visit Paris
for all kinds of reasons.

264
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,552
- Yeah, like getting engaged.
- No. They go to eat the amazing food...

265
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,221
- After getting engaged.
- No.

266
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,264
Or they go to see Oscar Wilde's grave.

267
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,807
- Before they get engaged.
- No.

268
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,769
Or they visit the Louvre
to make fun of all the people

269
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,687
taking blurry pictures
of an overrated painting.

270
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,315
Yeah. Where'd you and Rupert get engaged?

271
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,733
That doesn't matter.

272
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,694
See, that's what I'm talking about.

273
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,781
Right now,
Dr. Romance is probably getting ready

274
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,491
to pop the question
on top of the Eiffel Tower,

275
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,117
the most romantic
frigging place in the world.

276
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,371
Oh, please. The Eiffel Tower
is just a lamppost with a publicist.

277
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,458
Rebecca, come on. I just need to know
what's going on with them.

278
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,086
Please help me.

279
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,092
Okay, Ted. I'll make the call.

280
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,138
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

281
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,765
I didn't know Oscar Wilde was dead.

282
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,895
Some of his quotes feel so modern,
so of our time.

283
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:42,980
I know. Powerful.

284
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,691
Okay.

285
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,467
Come in.

286
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,429
Is now a good time, Ms. Jones?

287
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,055
Yes, of course. Yeah.

288
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,728
I'm sorry about what happened.

289
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,814
Thank you, Barbara.

290
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,109
Jack asked me to give you this.

291
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,527
What is it?

292
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,321
It's a statement.

293
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,202
"Allow me to first offer
my sincere apologies."

294
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,789
I deeply regret that video
that some of you have seen online.

295
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:48,587
"I'm beyond embarrassed, and I should have
never made this video in the first place."

296
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,967
"I hope you can forgive me
while I learn and grow."

297
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,766
Jack thought you could post it
across your socials.

298
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,812
But maybe not Facebook,
'cause that's just for

299
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,065
grandparents and racists now, isn't it?

300
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,315
Hey, Jamie? Jamie? Can I get some Lynx?

301
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,696
Yeah, sure, mate. What's your pit flavor?
I've got Epic Fresh, Sport Recharge, Java,

302
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,742
Africa, Ice Chill, Gold, Excite, Black,
Dark Temptation and Leather and Cookies.

303
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,287
- Leather and Cookies, please.
- Smart choice for a smart boy.

304
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,538
- There you go.
- Lovely stuff.

305
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,914
'Ey. Have you smelled this?

306
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:10,711
Yo! Yo, y'all see this? A bunch of famous
chicks got their nude photos leaked.

307
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,590
Oh, wow.

308
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,176
Hey, The Sun is calling
it "The Great A-wank-ening."

309
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,761
What is the opposite of clever?

310
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:20,888
The Sun.

311
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,057
Well, I guess I know
what I'm doing this weekend.

312
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,559
Oi, fuck that.

313
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,436
- We shouldn't be looking at that shit.
- Why not?

314
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,272
Because it wasn't meant for us,
Jan Maas. It was their private property.

315
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,192
Nah, bro. If you don't want
your private pictures out there,

316
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,861
- just don't take naked pictures.
- Yeah.

317
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,529
Especially being famous.

318
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,448
What? Come on, man.

319
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,491
- It's that simple.
- Fuck that, Cowburn. No, man.

320
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:45,162
The only people to blame are the dickheads
who steal your shit and put it online.

321
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,372
That's why I delete all the photos
on my phone.

322
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,958
I swear down.
Especially 'cause I'm famous.

323
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,336
Hey, listen. I'm with Jamie on this one.

324
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,004
Whenever I have a relationship end,

325
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,547
I ask the girl to go through my phone,

326
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,716
delete any photos, videos.
Whatever she wants.

327
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,718
- Bro, for real?
- Yeah. I'm being serious.

328
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,137
You know,
one girl actually deleted Candy Crush.

329
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,725
I was devastated, but I also understood.

330
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,853
Hey, hold on. Once someone sends you
a photo, don't you own it?

331
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,981
Copyright law on private photography
is quite murky.

332
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,777
It's not about the law. It's about doing
what is right. Like in Les Misérables.

333
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,029
Jean Valjean.

334
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,697
Fuck yeah, 24601.

335
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,367
No. 'Ey, deleting photos makes no sense.

336
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,369
What? Do we delete our memories too?

337
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,204
No, 'cause no one can steal your memories.

338
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,957
That's not entirely true.

339
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,750
- Yes.
- Nah.

340
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:32,793
What if I took the photo?

341
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,087
- You should delete it.
- What if it was a Christmas card?

342
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,213
Delete it, bro.

343
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,049
- What if it's artsy?
- What the fuck does that mean?

344
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,717
It's in black-and-white.
You can't see anything.

345
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,553
Delete it, mate.

346
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,762
What if I'm in the photo?

347
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:46,098
- Delete it.
- I know. What about sonograms?

348
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,768
- Delete that shit.
- What if I'm French?

349
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:53,272
- Delete it.
- What if she's naked, but not sexual?

350
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:56,024
- What the fuck? What is she doing in it?
- She's just defecating.

351
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,067
Delete it, bro.

352
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,571
- What about a commissioned painting?
- Is it in a nice frame?

353
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:01,989
It's leaning against my couch.

354
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,615
Gotta burn it, bro.

355
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,704
No, I shouldn't have to delete my
photos just because they might get stolen.

356
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,831
It's my stuff. Don't touch it.

357
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,375
I'm with that. That makes sense.

358
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,919
Hey, guys.

359
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,756
This article says Keeley
was one of the women who was hacked.

360
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,516
Right. Everybody, take out your phones.

361
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:33,562
Delete every single picture and video
that you've ever been sent. Now!

362
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,900
We're all targets for this shit.
So delete everything.

363
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,444
But we're professional footballers.
It could take days.

364
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,904
If not weeks.

365
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,155
Now!

366
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,787
Hey, man, take out your phone.

367
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:49,513
Colin. I wasn't playing.
I told you to delete that shit.

368
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,473
I will, man. Fuck off.

369
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,894
- I said delete it right now.
- Hey! Hey.

370
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:56,812
Fuck off.

371
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:31,180
This whole thing is so fucking upsetting.
I tried to watch the video this morning,

372
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:34,516
and immediately, boom,
I was right back to being 15 again,

373
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,145
reliving that moment
where this topless photo I took

374
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,106
for Jimmy Daniels
was being passed around at school.

375
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,192
Teenage boys can be awful.

376
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,568
Mr. Daniels was my teacher.

377
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:49,281
Well, men who act like teenage boys
actually are awful.

378
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,160
I'm not an idiot.

379
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:58,582
I know there are tons of topless photos
of me online. But those were my choice.

380
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:02,002
Absolutely. It makes a huge difference.

381
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,420
Yeah.

382
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,380
Is there anything I can do to help?

383
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:10,636
Restructure society so women
aren't constantly sexualized

384
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,597
while simultaneously being crucified
for being sexual?

385
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,682
On it.

386
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,397
- Should I be ashamed or embarrassed?
- What?

387
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,690
I don't know.

388
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,488
How did Jack respond?

389
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,198
Yeah, she was really lovely.

390
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,079
And then I got this from her.

391
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,714
She didn't write this.

392
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:52,427
- You don't think so?
- No, it's caked in lawyer ick.

393
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,221
You don't wanna say that, do you?

394
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,347
No.

395
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,685
Then tell her that.
Give her a chance to surprise you.

396
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,563
Thank you.

397
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,191
You know, there might be
a silver lining in all this.

398
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,654
Just think of how many young women you are
going to teach how to masturbate properly.

399
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,115
- What?
- I'm serious.

400
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,367
Back in the day,
I didn't have a clue what I was doing.

401
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,078
And then one day I accidentally bumped
into my parents' couch

402
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,746
and it felt nice, so I stuck with it.

403
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:23,625
A year later, my mum
had to have everything reupholstered.

404
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,170
I blamed the dog.

405
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,922
- Well, that was smart.
- Yeah, we didn't have a dog.

406
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,552
I love you.

407
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,098
I've got you.

408
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,643
Also, French sisters.

409
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,229
Spanish twins.

410
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,691
Mom and daughter in Mexico.

411
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,154
I'll miss you all. Merci.

412
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,824
- Hi. Thank you, love. Bye.
- Hi. Yeah.

413
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,831
Oi, Keeley.

414
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:04,917
Hi.

415
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:06,752
Hey.

416
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,341
I heard about what happened.
It's fucking shit.

417
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,093
Yeah, on so many levels.

418
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,638
I'm so sorry.

419
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,182
Thanks, Roy.

420
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,352
You okay?

421
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,772
All things considered, yeah. Yeah.

422
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,650
Good.

423
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,069
And you?

424
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,656
Me, yeah, I'm good.

425
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:43,664
Who was it for?

426
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:47,668
What?

427
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,003
The video. Who was it for?

428
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:58,637
Shit, I'm sorry, Keeley. I'm really sorry.

429
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,763
It's okay.

430
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,523
Fuck.

431
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,112
Fuck.

432
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:26,915
Babe?

433
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,000
In here.

434
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,717
Hey.

435
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,017
How you doing?

436
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:50,063
Better. Worse. Everything.

437
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,611
I got your statement.

438
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:01,909
Yeah, I'm sorry. I called my dad
for advice, and his lawyers got involved.

439
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,328
It's corporate fuckery at its finest.

440
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,875
Yet, you had Barbara give it to me.

441
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:16,340
Well, I tried to pick the most sensitive,
empathetic person I knew.

442
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,309
Jack, I can't do it.

443
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:29,603
I get it.

444
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,525
I'm just so sorry
you have to deal with all of this shit.

445
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,361
I'm sorry that you have to too.

446
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,626
How about, for the next few hours,
we pretend none of this shit happened?

447
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:58,757
Should we invite Barbara over?
Mess it all up?

448
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:01,677
Yeah, let's definitely do that.

449
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,345
I'll bet she's a party animal.

450
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,347
You actually have no idea.

451
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,057
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

452
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,602
"Asim was right, Marcus thought."

453
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:13,856
They were failing, and worse than that,
they were wasting time.

454
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,942
They were gonna wait another day
before meeting?

455
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:20,279
That would only leave two days,
and one of them was Saturday,

456
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,197
when they wouldn't be at Breakfast Club.

457
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,952
What if he never got his football
back from the creature? What if...

458
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,330
A large hand landed on Marcus's shoulder,

459
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:33,750
and he spun around
to find Mr. Anderson looking down at him.

460
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,670
"'I heard you went under the fence, '
he said."

461
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,507
Oh, boy.

462
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,011
We're gonna stop there for the night.
Cliff-hanger.

463
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,223
Hey, how was your flight out?

464
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,600
Good.

465
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:50,684
Yeah?

466
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:54,521
Do you know I have the most
air miles of any kid in my school?

467
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,606
Oh, yeah?

468
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,358
Yeah, that don't surprise me.

469
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:04,198
Things at school good though?
You and Doug back on track and all that?

470
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,324
Yeah.

471
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,826
We're starting a band.

472
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,037
Starting a band? Really?

473
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,665
All right.
What instrument are you gonna play?

474
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,000
Drums.

475
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,168
Drums.

476
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,463
Okay. Well, your mom's gonna love that.

477
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,174
You know what?
Now might be a good time to let you know

478
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,219
that Dave Grohl
learned to play drums on pillows.

479
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,388
We don't have to tell your mom that
though right away.

480
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,266
Yeah, exactly.

481
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,311
Not as fun.

482
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,649
Getting all your homework done?

483
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,735
I have to, or I can't watch TV.

484
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,030
Of course. You know how it goes.

485
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:49,076
- Homework. Dinner. TV time.
- Homework. Dinner. TV time.

486
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:50,827
That's right.

487
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,746
Good system.

488
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:56,458
Does…

489
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:03,048
Does Dr. Jacob ever, you know,
hang out around TV time with you?

490
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,592
Who is that?

491
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,933
No. Sorry. Jake. Mom's friend, Jake.

492
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,019
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes, yeah.

493
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,232
Yeah. That's all right.

494
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,027
Does he ever…

495
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,449
Read to you, like, at night?
Like, bedtime?

496
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,909
It's totally fine.

497
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,912
Nothing wrong with that,
I think that's great.

498
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:37,958
It's good to have people in your life that
are excited to be around you, you know?

499
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,919
Especially if, you know…

500
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,882
It's someone who makes your mom happy
and all that.

501
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,013
Which he seems to do.

502
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,309
You guys get along all right?

503
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,707
Come on, man.

504
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,634
Good morning.

505
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,639
Holy shit.

506
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,685
I didn't wanna wake you, so I went out
and did some cheeky retail therapy.

507
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,436
I loved it so much,
I didn't want to take it off.

508
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,772
- What do you think?
- You look incredible.

509
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:27,275
I mean, nothing but the best
for our dear Uncle Bernie, right?

510
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,570
Shit.

511
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,572
Babe, I canceled that.

512
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,283
I just... After the whole thing,

513
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,911
I thought you wouldn't want
to be around a bunch of press and cameras.

514
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,415
I'm sorry. I should've asked.

515
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,917
- I thought I was doing the right thing.
- No. Don't apologize.

516
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,588
You're right. Thank you.
I didn't think about that.

517
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,047
But you know what?

518
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,842
Leave it on, and I'll put on
my own killer fucking outfit,

519
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:56,513
and we can go do something stupid
and fun and look amazing while doing it.

520
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,307
Yeah, okay.

521
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,559
No, actually, take it off.

522
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:01,643
Oh, my God.

523
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,770
- Keep the hat on, but…
- Jesus.

524
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,732
…everything else is definitely coming off.

525
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,401
Okay, bud.

526
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,570
Coach and I got the whole day off.

527
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:15,449
We're talking no game,
no scouting, no nothing.

528
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,284
The world is our oyster.

529
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:24,583
Okay. Well, how about
the world is our shrimp cocktail?

530
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,752
Okay, great.

531
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:29,129
All right, Coach. What are our options?

532
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:34,134
There is a immersive
Jack the Ripper walking tour

533
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,178
that Jane's been raving about.

534
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:40,015
It's, like, six hours long,
and at one point, you get chased.

535
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,187
What are you nuts? I mean, he's a boy.

536
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,732
Fine, there's the London Eye.
There's the Tower of London.

537
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,901
There's all the London stuff.

538
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,319
There's a rave in Peckham.

539
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,779
Okay, Coach, I appreciate it.

540
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,533
Hey, big guy, what do you wanna do?
We could go to some museums.

541
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,285
We could rent a boat,
float down the Thames.

542
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:02,246
They spell it weird, but it is lovely.

543
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,249
I wanna go see a football game.

544
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,171
Okay.

545
00:36:11,255 --> 00:36:13,215
Let me see if I got this straight.

546
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,969
My one day off from football,
you wanna go watch football?

547
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:20,347
It's a little bit like asking a mailman
to go for a walk on his day off,

548
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,557
don't you think?

549
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:26,645
Yeah, you don't care. You're just a little
boy, ambivalent as all heck. Okay.

550
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,314
Coach, we got any games in town today?

551
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:31,692
There's one.

552
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,443
Well, there you go.

553
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:36,697
But I'm gonna have to stop at home first.

554
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,677
Look. There he is, there.

555
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,220
Hey, Nate!

556
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:03,974
Nate!

557
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:07,561
Nate!

558
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,982
Coach, look who came to watch.

559
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,484
Nate!

560
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,537
Must be looking for tips.

561
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:31,043
- He saw me, Dad. He saw me.
- Yeah, he did. He heard you too.

562
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,760
Holy shit.

563
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,971
Well, what can I say?
I'm the daughter of a billionaire.

564
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,307
I learned to read a green
before I learned to read a book.

565
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,228
Well, you might be a great golfer,
but I happen to be a really great cheater.

566
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,021
So I think that makes us even.

567
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,106
Watch out!

568
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,778
Oh, my goodness, it's a tie.

569
00:37:57,861 --> 00:37:59,738
- Uh-huh?
- Yes, look.

570
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:04,743
Isn't this way better than watching
polo with a bunch of old white men?

571
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:05,994
Definitely.

572
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,957
And I reckon the dinosaurs here
are much less handsy.

573
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,834
Oh, yeah, the dinosaurs are.

574
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:15,003
But I can't say the same
for some other people.

575
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:15,921
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

576
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,172
Jack?

577
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,468
Sorry. Excuse me.

578
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,053
Oh, my...

579
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,348
- Hi.
- Look at you. Nice suit.

580
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,476
What are you doing here?

581
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,144
My sister's hen do.

582
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,526
- She's marrying a golfer.
- A professional?

583
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,987
Oh, no. He just golfs.

584
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,364
We have to do a shot every hole,

585
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,283
but the good news is her friends suck.

586
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,577
Hello.

587
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,495
This is Alyssa. We went to uni together.

588
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,039
And this is my friend, Keeley Jones.

589
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,334
- Hi.
- Hi.

590
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,003
Keeley runs a PR firm.

591
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,881
You or your family ever need anyone,
this is who you want.

592
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,300
That's me.

593
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,301
Cool.

594
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:05,053
Alyssa! Come on!

595
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,722
- Coming, Sis!
- Hurry up!

596
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,015
Come on.

597
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:09,558
Fucking families.

598
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,769
Anyway, it was nice to see you, Jack.

599
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,605
- Yeah, you too.
- Love the hat.

600
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,607
Thanks. Yeah.

601
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,571
All right, let's make things
a little more interesting, shall we?

602
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:26,992
Ten pounds a hole,
but I will spot you 20 strokes.

603
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,535
- You're on.
- But no cheating.

604
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:30,412
Then only a pound a hole.

605
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,167
Great match, Coach.

606
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,622
- Hello, my darlings.
- Hey, Mae.

607
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,209
- What have you three been up to today?
- We went to the West Ham game.

608
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,257
Then you don't drink in this pub.

609
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,384
- Hey, come on, Mae.
- He's a child.

610
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:32,266
- Hey!
- Mae!

611
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:33,433
Thank you.

612
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:34,977
You think I wanted to fucking be there?

613
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,691
You two are on probation.

614
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:42,526
- Yes, ma'am.
- Fair enough.

615
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,236
Bye, Mae.

616
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,413
- Dad.
- Yeah?

617
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,248
- Listen.
- What?

618
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,000
The Beatles.

619
00:40:58,917 --> 00:40:59,877
Oh, yeah.

620
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,510
Hey, you know what? I'll be right back.

621
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,727
Hey, Boss, what do you got for me?

622
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,064
Right. Ted, listen, I want you to know,
you do not have to go down this road.

623
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,858
I know, but I need to, okay?

624
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,277
'Cause right now,
Michelle and this Dr. Jacob fella

625
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,488
could be sitting there, having dinner
at one of her favorite Parisian hotels,

626
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:29,573
like the George Sank…

627
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,325
- Cinq.
- …or the Plaza Anthony.

628
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:32,868
Athénée. Hold on.

629
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,370
Her favorite hotels in Paris?
I thought you said she'd never been there.

630
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:37,039
Yeah, she hasn't. But the George Stank…

631
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,291
- Cinq.
- …Is from her favorite movie, French Kiss,

632
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,210
- and the Plaza Anthony...
- Athénée.

633
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,836
That's from her favorite TV show,

634
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,505
- Sex in the City.
- Sex and the City.

635
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,590
Wait, what's all that noise?
Where are you?

636
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:47,799
Sounds like someone's singing.

637
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:50,427
Wh... No, I'm sorry.
I'm at a pub with Beard and Henry.

638
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,471
Why? Is it too loud?
I can step away further if that helps.

639
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:53,680
No, it's fine.

640
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,600
Where were we?

641
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,143
You think I'm nuts.

642
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,105
Thanks, Michael.

643
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,445
So, you like The Beatles, huh?

644
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,240
Why is that?

645
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,575
'Cause my dad does.

646
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,625
You know what this song's about?

647
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,628
Someone named Jude.

648
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:28,048
Not just someone. A little boy named Jude.

649
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:33,929
And one day his mom and dad decided
to break up. You know, get divorced.

650
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,140
And that made Jude real, real sad.

651
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:42,437
Now, Jude's dad had a best friend,

652
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:48,402
and that best friend was real worried
about Jude and all his sad feelings.

653
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,529
So he wrote him this song,

654
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,533
hoping that, well, the words might
help him somewhere down the road.

655
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:56,910
The long and winding road?

656
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,018
Hey, Henry.

657
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:24,646
You have a great mom and dad,
and they love you tons,

658
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,607
even though it's weird
they live in different countries.

659
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:32,154
And I know right now
it feels like you're in a sad song.

660
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:35,032
But you, young man,

661
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:39,953
you have the power to take a sad song
and make it better.

662
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:41,705
I like that.

663
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,207
Yeah, me too.

664
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,751
But you know what the best thing
about this song is?

665
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,211
What?

666
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,004
This!

667
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:02,351
Enjoy yourself, laddie!
Come on! Fucking sing it!

668
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,605
You know, Ted,
I'm so curious about something.

669
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:09,316
Why didn't you ever
take Michelle to Paris yourself?

670
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:12,528
Well, I wanted to. I mean, you know,
we were too broke to go on our honeymoon.

671
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,488
And then, well, we both got busy.

672
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:18,700
And then we had Henry, and I just...
I always thought we'd have more time.

673
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:20,827
Ted, I'm sorry.

674
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:21,995
Thank you.

675
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:27,501
But seriously, who gives a flying fuck
if Michelle gets engaged?

676
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:31,547
That time in your relationship with her
has passed,

677
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,549
but your time with Henry hasn't.

678
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,636
You need to stop letting yesterday
get in the way of today, Ted.

679
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,513
Well, I don't think
he's singing "Yesterday."

680
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:40,514
Ted.

681
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:42,224
No, I know. I'm just joking.

682
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,894
- And you're right.
- Of course, I'm right. I'm always right.

683
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,022
Now, for the love of God,
will you get back to that pub

684
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:51,024
and sing "Hey Jude" with your boy?

685
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:52,860
Mercy buckets, Boss.

686
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:54,945
De rien, Coach Lasso.

687
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,118
Thank you.

688
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,792
Yeah. Uh-huh.

689
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,086
No, I agree. It's much better.

690
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,172
Thank you, George.

691
00:45:56,548 --> 00:45:58,258
Okay, so, good news.

692
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:01,011
We've got a much more toned-down
version of the statement.

693
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,846
The last one was so shit.

694
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,640
Great.

695
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:07,476
I was once broken up with
by a guy's doorman.

696
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,397
I'm sorry, Ms. Hobbes,
Jonathan won't be coming down. Ever.

697
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,482
Hey.

698
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,904
I know it's lame.
But it will help, believe me.

699
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:22,991
Before, when you said
that you were gonna take care of this,

700
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:25,244
I thought that meant you were
gonna get the video taken down

701
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:28,080
- or something like that.
- We tried. It's the fucking Internet.

702
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:31,667
Making this statement
is taking care of it now.

703
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:35,045
By having me make an apology?

704
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,339
Yes.

705
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,926
Please just do it.

706
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:46,473
Sorry, but it's not a great look
when the person I'm seeing,

707
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:49,810
whose company I fund, has a porno online.

708
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,186
A porno?

709
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,065
You know what I mean. We're just...
We're limiting the damage. Okay?

710
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:57,776
Jack, I'm not doing it.

711
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:02,322
This video being leaked is not my fault.
But for some reason, you think it is.

712
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,576
Well, maybe, I don't know...
Maybe you shouldn't have made the video

713
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:06,952
in the first place.

714
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,997
It's certainly not something
to be proud of, Keeley.

715
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,584
I don't regret making that video.

716
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:17,129
And I don't regret sending it.

717
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,387
Are there more out there?

718
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,936
I don't know.

719
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,699
- What are you doing?
- I think I should go.

720
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:50,454
Are you coming back?

721
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,250
I don't know.

722
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:05,219
Right.

723
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:13,894
Do you want to go out and celebrate?

724
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,063
Celebrate what?

725
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,191
- Didn't you win today?
- Oh, yeah. But…

726
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:22,236
No. That's okay though.

727
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,321
Already working on the next one, so…

728
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,295
You should enjoy your victories.

729
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,182
It looks like they did.

730
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:03,902
There it is.

731
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:05,737
What?

732
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:07,823
I love your smile.

733
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,909
I like to see my boyfriend happy.

734
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:14,079
Boyfriend.

735
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:18,417
Yeah.

736
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,751
If you're into labels.

737
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,212
Yeah. No, I'm into labels. Sure.

738
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:23,922
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

739
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:28,135
- "This is Jade. She's my girlfriend."
- Yeah?

740
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:29,803
Sounds good, doesn't it?

741
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:31,805
"Nate. That's my boyfriend."

742
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:34,808
- Nate's your boyfriend?
- Yeah. Have you met him? He's amazing.

743
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,101
Thank you very much.

744
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:58,582
Jamie.

745
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,334
- Hey.
- Hi.

746
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,294
So, I'm sorry just to drop in on you.
I just...

747
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:05,005
- I was nervous to text you. I...
- Yeah.

748
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,007
I mean, like,
you and everyone in my family.

749
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,051
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

750
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,303
Well, I just... I wanted to check in
on you. See how you're doing.

751
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:15,098
It's just so fucking shit, all of this.

752
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:17,684
Thanks, Jamie.

753
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:22,314
Yeah, doing all right.

754
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:23,482
Yeah?

755
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:24,650
That's good.

756
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:28,487
And I also... I just...
I wanted to apologize.

757
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,531
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I do. Oh, no, I do.

758
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,241
- I do.
- Jamie, this is not your fault.

759
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:35,285
No, it is my fault.
And let me just... I just need to tell you.

760
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,704
I deleted it off my phone
way back when we broke up.

761
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:39,414
I deleted everything.

762
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,668
I mean, not straightaway,
'cause I did think that you and me

763
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,294
was maybe gonna get back together again.

764
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:49,383
But then you started going out with Roy,
and that's when I deleted most of it.

765
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,051
Well, like, half.

766
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:54,054
But that was mostly out of anger,
to be honest.

767
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:57,599
Because, well, I think...

768
00:50:57,683 --> 00:51:00,561
I thought the only reason that the two of
you was going out was to make me jealous.

769
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:01,895
But…

770
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:08,402
Then I saw it was real,
and then I got rid of it all.

771
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:12,656
I just forgot about the fucking emails.

772
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,409
It's so stupid.
I should have been more careful.

773
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,536
I should have picked
a stronger password or something.

774
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:18,620
Oh, no.

775
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,373
Don't tell me your password
was "password," Jamie.

776
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah.

777
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:27,254
Well, to be fair, I did think I'd fool 'em
'cause I spelled it with two S's.

778
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,345
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Keeley.

779
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,600
Really am.

780
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,814
Thank you, Jamie.

781
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,823
Excuse me, do you mind
taking a photo of me at the box?

782
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:56,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks.

783
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:59,161
- All right.
- No.

784
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,038
- It's like that. Yeah.
- All right.

785
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,623
- It's all right.
- Take a good one.

786
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,834
All right. Smile. There we go.

787
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:10,172
All right, big guy. Time to roll.
Let's do it.

788
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,258
- Bonjour!
- In here!

789
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:14,968
Hi, kiddo.

790
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:16,595
Mom!

791
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,598
I missed you.
Did you have fun with your dad?

792
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,808
Yeah. He's gonna buy me a drum kit.

793
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,311
- Is he really?
- W...

794
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:29,233
You know what? I love you, buddy.

795
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:30,359
I love you too, Dad.

796
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:32,194
All right, go on. Get outta here.

797
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,281
I don't know where he gets these ideas.

798
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:39,618
Hey, don't forget this thing.

799
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,206
What are you doing?

800
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:48,168
You... Sorry, I was screwing around.

801
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:49,378
Okay.

802
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:52,798
How was Paris?

803
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,592
It was all right.

804
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:59,263
Yeah. Well, that's what it's known for.
City of all rights.

805
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:01,890
Come on, Mom!

806
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,600
It was good seeing you.

807
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:05,394
Good seeing you too.

808
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,314
You know, Dave Grohl learned
to play drums on pillows.

809
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:10,399
I'm coming!

810
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:27,708
There he is. Huh?
