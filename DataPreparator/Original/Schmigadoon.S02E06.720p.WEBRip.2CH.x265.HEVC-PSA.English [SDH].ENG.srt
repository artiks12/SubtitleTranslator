[chuckles]

171
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,238
No, I'm fine. We're fine.

172
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:58,033
Go back to your rooms.
No one's in any danger.

173
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,662
Actually, that's not quite true, my sweet.

174
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,500
Last night, I saw Mr. Skinner
being taken at gunpoint

175
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,961
by that crooked policeman, Rivera.

176
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,296
- [gasps]
- And I did nothing.

177
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,589
We have to help him.

178
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,842
How can we help him?
We don't even know where he is.

179
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,468
[groans] I'm sure I can guess.

180
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:22,599
The same place Rivera took me
20 years ago for questioning.

181
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,103
The basement of Kratt's power plant.

182
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,898
You may get to kill someone yet.

183
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,441
Well, if providence is kind.

184
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,860
[chuckles, snorts]

185
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,238
- That was amazing.
- [sighs]

186
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,283
You know... [sighs]

187
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,789
It's so nice for once to get to be
the student instead of the teacher.

188
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,874
[chuckles]

189
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,169
Do you think there's even more
for me to learn about lovemaking?

190
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,837
Yeah, definitely.

191
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,631
It was great.

192
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,720
But, you know, even--
even Picasso kept taking lessons.

193
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,723
You know, there's always,
uh, more to learn.

194
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,517
- Great. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

195
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:06,852
[knocking on door]

196
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,146
- Go away!
- Come on.

197
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,731
[sighs]

198
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,610
Well. At least you're still getting naked.

199
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,694
What do you want?

200
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,822
Shouldn't you be out
following your new chosen leader, Josh?

201
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,157
Josh is in trouble.

202
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,117
Sergeant Rivera took him
to the power plant

203
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,203
so they can force Melissa to marry Kratt.

204
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,205
- We obviously don't care about Melissa...
- No.

205
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,250
...but we didn't know what to do,
so we came to you.

206
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,087
It's true Josh hurt me.

207
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,425
But sometimes, when your face
has been slapped,

208
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,429
you need to turn the other cheek
and let that person slap you again.

209
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,682
- But do you?
- Yeah, that sounds bad.

210
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,851
- Yeah, not the best example, darling.
- Oh.

211
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,521
But no matter what he did,
Josh is still our chum.

212
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,565
And if he needs our help, then we need to
be there for him no matter what.

213
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,860
You better gas up the happiness bus.
It's on.

214
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,529
[cheering] Yes!

215
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,655
[Topher] Let's roll.

216
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,744
And not only did Sloth set Chunk free
and get revenge on his evil family,

217
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:10,958
but he became friends with all the Goonies
and shared in their bounteous fortune.

218
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,544
- The end.
- [sighs] Good.

219
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,003
- Which reminds me of...
- [yelps]

220
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,923
...the parable of the dog
who was surprisingly good at basketball.

221
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,843
Start one more parable
and I'll kill you right now.

222
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,469
No, you won't.

223
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,098
Let Josh go now.

224
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,015
Topher?

225
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,059
Josh. I'm so sorry, man.

226
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,853
- A sour macaroon? [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

227
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,271
I don't even know what that means.

228
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,314
No worries. [chuckles] I love you, man.

229
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,275
- I love you too, man.
- [Rivera] Oh, brother.

230
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,612
If it isn't our troupe of
strolling fruitcakes come to save the day.

231
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,115
With what? Love?

232
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,951
Nice try. I've got this.

233
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,035
Wait.

234
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,206
Love is stronger than any gun.

235
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,457
Are you sure about that?

236
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,251
I'm not sure about that, no.

237
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,421
- [door opens]
- Not so fast!

238
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,755
That's right, copper.

239
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,593
- And who the hell are you?
- You don't recognize me, Sergeant Rivera?

240
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,720
Well, I suppose I can't blame you.

241
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,724
It has been 20 years
since you sent me to prison

242
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,476
for the murder of my wife, Daisy.

243
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,562
Dooley Blight?

244
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,646
In the flesh.

245
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:18,150
And thirsty for revenge.

246
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,693
Wait.

247
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,363
Daisy was my mother's name.

248
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:28,410
Hello, my daughter.

249
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,494
No.

250
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,163
I have no father.

251
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:35,083
Jenny. Jenny, believe me,
I never harmed your mother.

252
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,503
I loved her more than life itself.

253
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,506
I wish I could believe that, but I don't.

254
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,759
I want nothing to do with you.

255
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:48,096
Then I may as well
leave this hell for the next.

256
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,057
- [Michael, Codwell] No!
- Stop! Stop!

257
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,646
He's telling the truth.

258
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,190
And I know...

259
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,693
because I'm the one who framed him.

260
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,073
Kratt killed your mother, not Dooley.

261
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,539
[gasps]

262
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,042
- Oh, my Jenny, my Jenny.
- Daddy.

263
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,713
[Jenny sobs]

264
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,383
- [cries]
- All right.

265
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,177
Who wants to help me stop a wedding?

266
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,387
- [cheers]
- I do!

267
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,182
[Narrator] We are gathered here today
to join Octavius and Melissa

268
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,642
in holy matrimony.

269
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,229
Do you, Octavius, take Melissa
to be your lawful wedded wife?

270
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,357
[groans]

271
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,192
I do.

272
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,445
Do you, Melissa, take Octavius
to be your lawful wedded husband?

273
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,906
I have no choice.

274
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,325
That counts!

275
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,245
Then by the power vested in me
by the city of Schmicago,

276
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,663
I pronounce you ma--

277
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,540
- Stop the wedding!
- [Melissa] Josh!

278
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,958
You. How did you--

279
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,836
You need to shut your stupid mouth
and get away from my wife.

280
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,297
[chuckles] Adorable.

281
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,464
- Seize him.
- [Josh] What?

282
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,633
Officers, stand down!

283
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,218
What do you think you're doing?

284
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,721
Standing up to you. For once.

285
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,848
And so am I.

286
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,683
Enough is enough, Octavius!

287
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,145
I'm afraid the two of you
have overplayed your hand.

288
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,772
They don't answer to you.
They answer to me.

289
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,025
- [inhales deeply] Take him away. Now.
- [grunts]

290
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,570
I love you, Mel!
And I'm so sorry for this whole mess!

291
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,489
I love you too! No matter what happens,
I'll always love you!

292
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,409
Enough of this prattle.
Pronounce us man and wife.

293
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,372
By the power vested in me by the city of
Schmicago, I now pronounce you--

294
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,208
- Vengeance!
- Dooley Blight?

295
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,502
- Is mine!
- No, Daddy, no!

296
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,759
[gasps, breathes shakily]

297
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,845

300
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,104
You just keep on losing,
don't you, Blight?

[guests gasping]

302
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,319
[Kratt] Not so fast, my sweet.

303
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,614
Finish the ceremony.

304
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:15,577
Mr. Kratt, as your lawyer, I must advise--
Myself to sit back down.

305
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,119
Finish it!

306
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,166
Okay, um, then by the power vested in me
by the city Schmicago,

307
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,794
- I pronounce you man and--
- Look up!

308
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,753
- [guests screaming]
- [Josh] Get out the way!

309
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,342
Oh, shit.

[wedding guests scream]

311
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,221
Oh!

312
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,728
[exhales sharply] Seriously? Again?

313
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,023
It really is a wonderful knife.

314
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:46,650
[sighs]

315
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,403
My love.

316
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,408
- Are you all right? [sighs]
- Yeah, I am now.

317
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,451
- I love you.
- I love you.

318
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,164

<i>Madam Frau will take over the club</i>
